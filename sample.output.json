            "content": "US President Donald Trump said Monday in a rant-filled diatribe about celebrities who backed Kamala Harris that pop diva Beyonce got US$11mil for endorsing his campaign rival. Trump provided no evidence to back up his free-wheeling allegations over Beyonce or other entertainers he attacked as he announced \"a major investigation\" into what he said were payments by the failed Democratic candidate to stars like Bruce Springsteen, Oprah Winfrey and Bono for them to support her against Trump. Trump, six months after he beat Harris to launch a second term in the White House, said these payments he alleges took place amounted to illegal campaign contributions. He alleged that for a Harris rally in late October in which the Freedom singer made an appearance, \"Beyonce was paid US$11,000,000 to walk onto a stage, quickly ENDORSE KAMALA, and walk off to loud booing for never having performed, NOT EVEN ONE SONG!\" Trump said this was \"according to news reports.\" Harris had told the rally crowd at the time that \"I'm not here as a celebrity. I'm not here as a politician. I'm here as a mother.\" Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that he would \"call for a major investigation into this matter.\" \"Candidates aren't allowed to pay for ENDORSEMENTS, which is what Kamala did, under the guise of paying for entertainment,\" he said. Harris had sought to harness star power from celebrities such as Beyonce, Winfrey and Springsteen in the election race. Winfrey has defended a US$1mil payment to her production company from the Harris campaign to cover costs associated with the talk show legend's production company hosting the presidential candidate at a rally in September. Harris's team, meanwhile, has denied rumours that she paid Beyonce to appear at a rally. The campaign listed one endorsement-related expenditure for US$75 in its financial reports to an environmental advocacy group. Trump, who won the 2024 election comfortably, received scant support from the entertainment industry at large but tapped into a targeted subset of well-known, hypermasculine influencers including podcast host Joe Rogan. The president on Monday accused Harris of paying rock star Springsteen to perform at a rally in Georgia weeks before the election. \"How much did Kamala Harris pay Bruce Springsteen for his poor performance during her campaign for president?\" he wrote. \"Why did he accept that money if he is such a fan of hers?\" Trump last week took to Truth Social to feud with Springsteen after the star told a British concert audience that his homeland is now ruled by a \"corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration.\" In return, the 78-year-old Republican said the star, nicknamed \"the Boss,\" is \"Highly Overrated.\" Springsteen is an outspoken liberal critic of Trump and turned out for Harris after she replaced Democratic president Joe Biden in his abandoned reelection bid. – AFP",

            "content": "Presented by Lloyds Banking GroupBy STEFAN BOSCIAwith BETHANY DAWSONPRESENTED BY Send tips here | Subscribe for free | Listen to Playbook and view in your browserGood Thursday morning. This is Stefan Boscia.DRIVING THE DAYUNCORK THE GAUKE: The government will today announce a series of monumental changes to Britain’s criminal justice system, with the help of a former Tory. David Gauke’s independent sentencing review lands with a thud this morning as he seeks to end the prison capacity crisis by calling for shorter custodial sentences — potentially even for some rapists and killers. Ministers are desperately hoping the changes stop more waves of early prisoner releases and the politically damaging scenes they engendered. But they should be careful about what they wish for, because today’s measures come with their own political risk.Quick set up: Gauke, an ex-justice secretary, says Britain is projected to have another 9,800 prisoners by early 2028. This would lead to chaos since prisons are already at bursting point, with another round of convicts granted early release last week to free up space. With no chance of increasing capacity until Labour’s prison-building program starts to yield results (that’ll be years away), Gauke reckons his measures will bring down reoffending rates and shorten many jail sentences.On her feet: Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood will deliver a Commons statement this afternoon, where she will accept the vast majority of Gauke’s recommendations. The biggest pillar of this will be slashing custodial sentences for thousands of prisoners — including some who were been banged up for sexual or violent offences. **A message from Lloyds Banking Group: The UK urgently needs more social rent homes. Our new prospectus for action outlines proposals to help deliver them – including two new investment mechanisms that could unlock up to 200,000 homes over the next decade, plus wider reforms to strengthen the sector. Find out more.**Into the details: A large tranche of convicted prisoners with good behavior will only have to serve one-third of their sentence in prison, before spending another third under close supervision in the community. This will include enhanced use of electronic tags and other strict conditions in a bid to cut reoffending rates. They will then spend the last third “on license” under a reduced supervision regime.This could cause problems: Many prisoners who have committed sexual or violent crimes, with sentences of over four years, will only need to serve half their sentence in prison if they are judged as being well-behaved; previously, they needed to serve at least two-thirds.Not so fast: However, officials say Mahmood will not accept Gauke’s call for less prison time for people who have been given “extended determinate sentences.” People who have been given these longer sentences are deemed to be a greater risk to society. They will continue to serve two-thirds of their sentences in prison before being eligible for parole hearings.Yikes: The review also calls for the government to carefully look at more widespread chemical castration of sex offenders. But the Sun’s Jack Elsom revealed last night that Mahmood wants to go further and is looking at making chemical castration mandatory for some sex offenders. The paper splashed on this, with the headline: “Paedos to be castrated.” Extra, extra, don’t read about it: Worth noting that the Sun was the only outlet allowed to feature the sentencing review on its front page, because the MoJ told other newspapers that details were embargoed until 6 a.m. ... which went down about as well as you’d expect with Lobby hacks last night.BEST OF THE REST: The other key recommendations in Gauke’s review are that short prison sentences of 12 months or less will only be handed out in “exceptional circumstances” (like breaching a court order or for some domestic violence cases) ... that suspended sentences should be made available for custodial sentences of up to three years instead of two years ... and that there should be a higher bar to recall paroled prisoners after being released. The Times’ Matt Dathan has a thorough rundown of the proposals.Quick reax: The Law Society of England and Wales said it supported the government in focusing “on alternatives to the use of custody, which is an expensive and often counterproductive form of punishment.” But Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick said that “by scrapping short prison sentences, Starmer is effectively decriminalizing crimes like burglary, theft and assault.”Easy for him to say: Gauke admitted to Dathan that these reforms will be “politically challenging.” He added: “A policy of relying very heavily on imprisonment has unbalanced our system and although imprisonment is going to continue to be an important part of our system, our prison population is still going to be twice as high as it was in 2010.”Catch him now: The government has also sent Gauke out for this morning’s broadcast round instead of the usual ministerial pick. He will pop up on Sky at 7.30 a.m. and Today at 8.05 a.m. (full times below).RISKY BUSINESS: Expect to also see plenty of questions around why Mahmood is going to allow sex offenders back on the streets earlier and whether this will threaten community safety. You can just imagine the headlines if/when one of these people reoffends in a particularly heinous way. However, a government aide told Playbook that the “scale of challenge we face means we have to tackle even these longer sentences.”Show me the money: Martin Jones, HM chief inspector of probation, told the Guardian’s Rajeev Syal that making criminals serve more of their sentence in the community poses a “catastrophic risk” unless the entire probation system is overhauled (i.e., is given more cash). The MoJ has already secured £700 million from Rachel Reeves to fund thousands of electronic tags and new probation officers.Cross purposes: There’s also the tension between the government’s tough-on-crime rhetoric and the need to free up prison places in the short term. Gauke is calling for the creation of a quango to review new government legislation and forecast how many prison places would be added by each change. However, Playbook is told this one won’t be taken up.BLOWN OUT OF THE WATER? Despite all the careful planning (or perhaps because of it), the sentencing review may well be blown off the top of the news agenda in favor of today’s immigration stats. The ONS will release the provisional 2024 immigration figures at 9.30 a.m. here in what will likely be a free hit for Labour. After all, the figures will still be representative of the last government’s policies.FUELING THE FIREWHAT’S NEXT? After Keir Starmer’s screeching U-turn on winter fuel, hacks are already sniffing out the government’s next potential fiscal backslide. The Guardian’s Pippa Crerar reports Starmer has told his top team that scrapping the two-child benefit cap should be on the table, after previously refusing calls for that from Labour backbenchers. She also reports Rachel Reeves is set to announce a £750 million package to fight child poverty at next month’s spending review.The sound of a clunking fist: The PM and Reeves came under further pressure to scrap the cap last night from one of Labour’s proper big beasts. Gordon Brown told ITV’s Robert Peston that “the cost-effective way of getting more children out of poverty, about 500,000 children out of poverty, is abolishing the two-child rule.” He said the cap resulted from “a wrong diagnosis of the poverty problem — poverty used to be related to unemployment, it’s now low pay.”Let’s get fiscal: Good to remember that the final decision on this will partly depend on the fiscal situation Reeves takes to the autumn budget. Handily, the ONS just released April’s net borrowing figures. Read them here.Taking it to the house: It comes after Starmer shocked the Commons on Wednesday by suddenly announcing at PMQs that he would backtrack on the cuts to the winter fuel payment. He said the £11,500 threshold would be lifted to ensure more pensioners receive the £300 payment. Playbook PM had a rundown of the announcement. Paper round: The U-turn splashed the Guardian, FT, Mail, Express, Times, Mirror and Metro this morning.Victory lap: The Express has reason to be cheerful because it can claim victory for its months-long campaign to get Reeves to U-turn on winter fuel. But Tory Leader Kemi Badenoch told Martyn Brown the “fight isn’t over” as ministers scramble to find a new way to means test the payment in a more generous way. Shadow Chancellor Mel Stride writes in the Telegraph that the government should “come clean — if they are now going to give back the winter fuel payment to millions of those who were deprived of it, where is the money going to come from?”Winter is coming: There are now questions over the timing of any changes, after No. 10 all but confirmed the new plan will be outlined at the autumn budget. Brown, again talking to ITV, pointed out that payments are handed out from October and that a decision must be “made pretty soon.” That suggests any changes made at the autumn budget would be too late for this winter.Warring neighbors: Anushka Asthana has a good piece in the Sun on how the original decision to take away the winter fuel allowance from millions unfolded. She writes that Starmer felt he had been led into a disaster and didn’t get any political advice on the decision. But to be fair to Reeves, shouldn’t the prime minister have had the nous to ask more questions at the time? Who’s in charge here? The piece also includes a great anecdote about Starmer’s reaction to Lou Haigh’s pay deal with striking train drivers (which seems to confirm a Harry Cole scoop from September). Asthana writes that while Haigh had consulted with No. 10 on the policy, the PM only found out about the decision from the radio. He then stormed into a meeting and furiously asked: “What the hell is going on here?” HERE WE GO AGAIN: The Telegraph’s Ben Riley-Smith has released more of Angela Rayner’s explosive memo to Reeves, which has revealed a split in the heart of government. After urging Reeves to hike taxes on wealthy Brits by £4 billion, the deputy PM also called on the chancellor to make it harder for some immigrants to access public services. Details, details: Rayner said the government should restrict recently arrived immigrants’ access to the state pension and Universal Credit while also making them pay more to use the NHS.Making it Rayn: Speculation was rife across the parliamentary estate on Wednesday that Rayner was on maneuvers and had leaked the memo herself. Particularly as her calls for tax hikes went down very well among left-wing and soft-left Labour MPs. One government aide told Playbook that the source of the leak was “obviously” Rayner. “Because it always is,” they added. The deputy PM’s allies categorically deny the allegation.Rolling the pitch: The Times’ Oliver Wright and Aubrey Allegretti are told by some Labour MPs that Rayner is pitching herself as a more left-wing alternative to Starmer. “Angela has been loyal in public but she knows she needs to distance herself from some of the unpopular policies,” one said. And people said this government would be no fun! TODAY IN WESTMINSTERSIGNED, SEALED, DELIVERED: Keir Starmer is set to finalize the handover of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius in a virtual signing ceremony today, according to the Telegraph’s Tony Diver. (It comes after GB News reported on Tuesday night that a deal would come this week.) Diver writes that the final deal is expected to cost Britain £9 billion in payments to the Mauritian government for long-term use of the Diego Garcia military base.CHARGED: Liam O’Hanna, a member of the rap group Kneecap, has been charged with a terror offense for allegedly displaying a flag in support of Hezbollah during a gig at the O2 Forum in Kentish Town. O’Hanna is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on June 18. The arrest is sure to ignite plenty of chatter in SW1, after Kneecap told fans attending a 2023 gig to “kill your local MP.” Sky News has the story.SCOOP — COMING FROM THE LAND DOWN UNDER: Fresh off winning a historic landslide, several senior Australian Labor Party strategists are in London this week for top-level meetings with No. 10 and Labour officials. Morgan McSweeney and his lieutenants want to learn how Anthony Albanese won big this month after a wobbly first term during which the Aussie PM endured dire personal approval ratings and complaints about his lack of vision. (Sound familiar?)MAKING THE PIP SQUEAK: Rachel Reeves is calling for G7 countries to cut the $60 cap on Russian oil to put more pressure on Vladimir Putin. Bloomberg’s Joe Mayes has more.STARK WARNING: Former Cabinet Secretary Simon Case said Britain should start spending 3 percent of its GDP on defense “right now” to counter an “axis of rival and enemy states.” Speaking on the General and the Journalist podcast, featuring Tom Newton Dunn and Patrick Sanders, he said the U.K.’s defense spending and infrastructure have been undermined by “decades of underinvestment” and “a dangerous sense of complacency.”X-RATED: The social media platform known as X has taken a dive in many ways since the Musk takeover, not least when it comes to the amount of smut that appears on users’ feeds. Because of that, my colleague Sam Blewett messages in to say, MPs have been warning each other to break the habit of scrolling in the chamber. As one Labour backbencher puts it, they don’t want to become the next Neil Parish.IN THE HOT SEAT: Disability Minister Stephen Timms will give a speech on “expanding economic activity” at 7 p.m., hosted by Bright Blue. It comes on the heels of Keir Starmer’s winter fuel U-turn and Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall saying in a speech on Wednesday that welfare “won’t be there for people who really need it” unless it is reformed.HE’S BACK: Spectator Editor and former Conservative frontbencher Michael Gove will formally return to parliament today, as a member of the House of Lords. His introduction is at 11 a.m.TRADE TENSIONS: The U.K. has been accused of undermining World Trade Organization rules through its trade pact with the U.S., potentially straining Britain’s “reset” with the European Union. POLITICO’s Sophie Inge, Caroline Hug and Jakob Weizman have the story.REPORTS OUT TODAY: The government should put remote general hospitals and virtual wards at the center of the 10-year plan for the NHS to slash waiting times, according to an analysis by Re:State’s Rosie Beacon ... and it should reimagine its trade strategy to put more emphasis on faster, targeted market access deals, says the Tony Blair Institute. HOUSE OF COMMONS: Sits from 9.30 a.m. with culture, media and sports questions ... questions to a range of commissioners ... business questions to Leader of the House Lucy Powell ... a select committee statement on the sixth report of the Business and Trade Committee, on “How to strengthen UK-EU relations: Policy Priorities for the Summit” ... a select committee statement on the third report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, “Legislative Scrutiny: Mental Health Bill” ... consideration of Lords messages on the Data (Use and Access) Bill ... a general debate on access to NHS dentistry (led by Labour MP Melanie Onn). Labour MP Markus Campbell-Savours has the adjournment debate on the A66 Northern Trans-Pennine Project.

A spokesperson for the Israeli Embassy said the people were shot “at close range while attending a Jewish event” at the museum, CNN reports.PALESTINE TALKS: The Guardian’s Patrick Wintour reports that British officials will begin discussing officially recognizing Palestine as a state with other Western countries this week. It comes after Israeli soldiers fired warning shots near a group of diplomats in the West Bank, including one British diplomat. Foreign Minister Hamish Falconer has called for a full investigation. Sky News has more on that.TRUMP ON PUTIN: U.S. President Donald Trump told European leaders during their phone call on Monday that Vladimir Putin isn’t ready to end Russia’s war on Ukraine because he thinks he’s winning, the Wall Street Journal reports, citing three people familiar with the conversation.NEW LINE UP: Reform UK is expected to elect former BBC journalist Linden Kemkaran as Kent County Council leader at the council annual meeting at 10 a.m., the Beeb reports.KER-CHING: The Tata Steel/Port Talbot Transition Board is set to approve £21.2 million in funding for regeneration projects that will bring an estimated 270 jobs to the area and gross valued-added benefits of £119 million to the local economy, according to the Wales Office.ANOTHER CONFRONTATION IN THE OVAL OFFICE: Relations between the U.S. and South Africa sank to a new low as Donald Trump, sitting next to South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa in the White House, declared that white farmers in the country were being violently persecuted. Trump showed a video of Black activists calling for seizing the land of white farmers and showing gravestones that he offered as proof of a “genocide.” Ramaphosa rejected the claims, saying speeches by “a small minority party” were “not government policy” and that he was unfamiliar with the images of the graves.

At Lloyds Banking Group, we believe the private sector has a critical role to play in addressing this challenge. That’s why we’ve published a new prospectus for action – a set of policy and investment proposals to help deliver the social homes the country needs. The paper includes two new investment mechanisms that could support the delivery of up to 200,000 social rent homes over the next decade. We’re also calling for wider reforms to strengthen the social housing sector, from unlocking land and accelerating planning, to boosting investor confidence and supporting housing associations to scale. This is a bold step forward – part of our wider commitment to champion social housing and help build a more resilient and inclusive housing system for the future.

            "content": "AMSTERDAM , May 22, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Hassan Badrawi , CEO of OCI Global: \"OCI entered 2025 with positive momentum, following a year marked by significant portfolio changes. In the first quarter, we delivered on key transaction milestones, including the resolution of the previously disclosed dispute with our Natgasoline joint venture partner Proman regarding the sale of OCI Methanol to Methanex, as well as substantial progress on the construction of the Beaumont New Ammonia plant, scheduled for completion later this year. Operationally, our European portfolio performed well during the period, despite planned shutdowns at certain assets. In line with our approach to disciplined capital returns, OCI distributed USD 1.0 billion to shareholders in May, bringing cumulative distributions to USD 6.4 billion over the past four years. OCI continues to prioritize shareholder value whilst preserving capital allocation flexibility and strategic optionality. Any future extraordinary cash distributions will be determined based on transaction progress, the ongoing strategic review, and Board approval. As part of our ongoing transformation, OCI also secured a binding support agreement with a large group of bondholders regarding the treatment of the 2033 bonds, pending completion of the Methanol sale. This will facilitate an orderly pay down of OCI's capital structure following the closing of the transaction. Looking ahead, our main priorities are to complete the construction and handover of Beaumont New Ammonia, and to close the Methanol transaction as planned in Q2 2025. With a simplified corporate structure, a stable balance sheet, and a competitive European nitrogen platform, OCI is well-placed to execute on its current objectives and to support value creation.\" Key Financial Highlights Continuing Operations Adjusted EBITDA for Q1 2025 continued to show a loss, but performance improved over the prior quarter as corporate cost reduction measures gained traction. The European Nitrogen segment's profitability was challenged during the quarter by higher gas prices year-on-year and a planned turnaround that negatively impacted EBITDA margin. Despite these headwinds, the segment continues to be profitable and is well-positioned to benefit from the anticipated decrease in European gas prices. OCI has accelerated its efforts to streamline the corporate cost structure, achieving meaningful progress in aligning the organization to its post-divestment footprint. The Company remains on track to beat its previously guided corporate cost target of USD 30 - 40 million on a run rate basis by the end of 2025. Within Discontinued Operations, OCI Methanol delivered a resilient financial performance in Q1 2025 notwithstanding a planned turnaround at the OCI Beaumont plant. Results were supported by elevated methanol prices and reduced natural gas hedge losses compared to the same period last year, as well as a record performance at Natgasoline, which successfully resumed operations at the end of last year. Net cash from Continuing Operations stood at USD 1,033 million as of 31 March 2025 compared to a net cash position of USD 1,371 million as of 31 December 2024 . Key Strategic and Business Highlights The announced sale on 8 September 2024 of OCI's global methanol business (\"OCI Methanol\") to Methanex Corporation (\"Methanex\") has been approved by both companies' boards and is expected to close in Q2 2025, subject to regulatory approvals and customary conditions. On 14 May 2025 , the European Commission (EC) announced it had approved the acquisition under the EU Merger Regulation, concluding that the transaction does not raise competition concerns. In March 2025 , OCI secured a favorable and final resolution of the previously disclosed dispute with Proman regarding shareholder rights in its Natgasoline joint venture. Following a Delaware Court of Chancery ruling in OCI's favor and the subsequent withdrawal of Proman's appeal, OCI's 50% interest in Natgasoline remains part of the transaction perimeter. Construction of the Beaumont New Ammonia site is well advanced and nearing completion, with engineering and procurement mostly complete, and the team currently preparing for commissioning and startup later this year. The project remains on track in terms of total cash spend, which stood at USD 1,167 million as of 31 March 2025 . OCI made a further extraordinary distribution of approximately USD 1 billion as a repayment of capital or at the election of the shareholder, from the profit reserve in May 2025 , bringing total cumulative distributions to USD 6.4 billion over the last four years. In April 2025 , OCI reached a Support Agreement with a bondholder group representing over 60% of its USD 600 million 6.700% Notes due 2033, relating to the treatment of the bonds following contemplated completion of the announced sale of OCI Methanol. Under the Support Agreement, OCI will launch a tender offer for the bonds within five business days of the successful closing of the transaction at 110.75% of par plus accrued and unpaid interest, with the bondholder group agreeing to support and tender into such offer. The group also agreed to support proposed amendments to the bonds, including a redemption right on or after closing at the same price and a waiver of any alleged defaults or events of default that may be outstanding under the documentation governing the bonds. With regards OCI's strategic review, the Company remains actively engaged in the evaluation of strategic alternatives for its continuing businesses. Any future decisions will be made in the best interests of all shareholders. Continuing and Discontinued Operational Highlights Continuing Operations, as presented in this trading update, reflect the performance of the European Nitrogen segment. Further to the announcement of the expected divestiture of OCI's equity holdings in OCI Methanol, this segment is classified as Discontinued Operations. European Nitrogen Own-produced sales were 484 thousand tonnes during the first quarter of 2025, materially unchanged year-on-year and 16% higher quarter-on-quarter. Despite a planned turnaround of the ammonia line as well as the UAN and CAN plants during the quarter, overall production levels were stable year-on-year, supported by the production of new products including AdBlue and CAN+S. Benchmark prices for nitrates were higher in Q1 2025 compared to Q1 2024 and showed a sequential improvement quarter-on-quarter. In February 2025, OCI Nitrogen, Dossche Mills and AGRAVIS announced major progress in their partnership to scale sustainable wheat production across Europe . Using low-carbon fertilizers and farmer incentives, the initiative enabled a tenfold increase in sustainable wheat harvested in 2024, delivering 14,000 tonnes - enough for twenty-five million lower-carbon loaves of bread. The partners aim to triple production in the coming years while maintaining quality and supporting farming practices. In March 2025, OCI Global partnered with RWZ to supply low-carbon fertilizers to RWZ and BASF's \"KlimaPartner Landwirtschaft\" carbon farming initiative. The collaboration, utilising OCI's low-carbon nitrogen solutions, supports climate-smart practices across 8,200 hectares of winter wheat and aims to cut CO2-equivalent emissions per tonne of yield by 30%, helping future-proof arable farming with ecological and economic benefits. In April 2025, OCI, alongside Trammo, James Fisher Fendercare and other partners, successfully completed the Port of Rotterdam's first ammonia ship-to-ship bunkering pilot, transferring eight hundred cubic meters of liquid ammonia. The safe execution of this milestone highlights the strategic value of OCI's ammonia import terminal and distribution infrastructure in enabling the adoption of clean ammonia as a marine fuel and supporting the decarbonisation of global shipping. OCI Methanol Own-produced methanol sales from the methanol business were 233 thousand tonnes in the first quarter of 2025, 34% lower than Q1 2024 and 7% lower than Q4 2024. Volumes were impacted by a planned turnaround at OCI Beaumont, while Natgasoline ran at a 95% AUR in Q1 2025 following its successful restart at the end of 2024. Benchmark prices for methanol were materially improved in the quarter compared to the same period last year. Spot US Gulf Coast methanol prices averaged USD 370 /t in Q1 2025, 17% higher than the USD 317 /t averaged in Q1 2024.

            "description": "Philippines’ Marcos Tells All Ministers to Quit in ‘Bold Reset’",
            "content": "Manila: In an unprecedented move, Philippine President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr. has requested all members of his Cabinet to submit their courtesy resignations in response to his party’s poor showing in the recent midterm elections. The reshuffle comes as the Philippines grapples with the global trade war, and investors will want to see if key officials like Finance Secretary Ralph Recto are kept on. What does this mean? A courtesy resignation is a formal gesture where officials offer to step down from their posts, allowing the president to reorganise or reshuffle his team without the need to directly fire anyone. It signals accountability and gives the president flexibility to assess who stays, who goes, and how to recalibrate the administration’s direction following political setbacks. In announcing his entire Cabinet to quit, he also unveild a bid to “recalibrate” his administration to better meet the expections of Filipinos. Realignment “It’s time to realign government with the people’s expectations,” Marcos said in a statement released by his communications office on Thursday. “The people have spoken, and they expect results — not politics, not excuses. We hear them, and we will act.” Will the president reappoint some? Yes, it is widely expected that the president may reappoint some Cabinet secretaries after their so-called courtesy resignations. Philippine growth missed estimates in the first quarter, but the economy has still been expanding at faster than 5% pace, with the currency up 4% against the dollar this year. Expert's take “If it actually materialises that the entire cabinet resigns, it will be too disruptive from an economic standpoint,” said Euben Paracuelles, Chief Asean Economist at Nomura Holdings Inc. “I think reform prospects were already dimming but other urgent matters such as trade talks with the US and implementation of counter-cyclical policies could be affected.” Recto and the economic planning agency didn’t immediately respond to requests for comments, as per Bloomberg. Interior and Local Government Secretary Jonvic Remulla said he will submit his resignation later Thursday, the Inquirer reported. Information and Communications Technology Secretary Henry Aguda said he stands by Marcos. Manila’s key stock index was down 1% and the peso was little changed against the greenback at 9:45 a.m. local time. The president’s action echoes a similar move by former President Gloria Arroyo. In both 2005 and 2009, facing calls to step down, Arroyo asked her cabinet officials to resign. Decisive action needed Marcos is “fully aware of the people’s sentiments and is willing to take drastic actions to make his commitment to the people even clearer,” said Ederson Tapia, professor of public administration at the University of Makati. “He does need to take decisive action, especially since some have already alluded to him being a ‘lame duck’ president.” The resignation request gives “elbow room to evaluate the performance of each department and determine who will continue to serve in line with his administration’s recalibrated priorities,” the president’s statement said. Setback May 12’s midterm elections represented a setback for Marcos and improved the prospects of his impeached political rival Vice President Sara Duterte. Duterte-backed candidates won at least four of the 12 Senate seats up for grabs in the election. A fifth candidate, who was part of Marcos’ slate, but who also sought Duterte’s backing, also won. Two liberal politicians who were not part of Marcos’ slate also had unexpected victories. The senators will all be jurors when the 24-member chamber begins Duterte’s impeachment trial that’s expected to start in July. The Senate would need a two-thirds vote to convict Duterte, which may be tougher given her allies’ victories in the Senate and in other regional elections. Earlier this week, Marcos said he’s willing to reconcile with the family of Duterte, stressing he wants stability “so that we can do our jobs.” “With this bold reset, the Marcos administration signals a new phase — sharper, faster, and fully focused on the people’s most pressing needs,” the statement from Marcos’ office said Thursday. --With assistance from Neil Jerome Morales, Cliff Venzon and Andreo Calonzo.

            "description": "In today’s newsletter: After weeks of denial, Keir Starmer has announced plans to widen eligibility, but ​with criticism from both opponents and Labour MPs, the government’s handling of cost-of-living policies faces renewed scrutiny",
            "content": "Good morning. Earlier this month, Pippa Crerar and Jessica Elgot reported that the government was rethinking arguably the most unpopular policy introduced by Labour since the election: the cut to winter fuel payments for pensioners. Nonsense, No 10 sources insisted in the following days: “There isn’t a review and I’d be amazed if we changed anything.” No 10 sources are now, presumably, amazed, because yesterday Keir Starmer announced exactly what had been so strenuously denied: a plan to loosen eligibility requirements so that more pensioners qualify, to be introduced at the autumn budget . This isn’t a complete U-turn: fewer pensioners will receive the payment than before Rachel Reeves’s decision of 2024. But it is a very significant step. Many Labour MPs – to say nothing of the pensioners who lost out – will be wondering why the government went ahead with such a painful policy in the first place for such minimal economic gain. But even if the criticisms have been painful, Starmer insists that the change is possible because of a brightening economic outlook. Against that optimistic gloss is the argument that Labour is acting because it knows the policy was a colossal misjudgement. Today’s newsletter explains how the change came about, and what it means in practice. Here are the headlines. Five big stories In depth: The totem that turned into an albatross – and then a reverse ferret The winter fuel payment is worth about £200 a year to pensioners under 80, and £300 for those who are older. When the government changed the rules last year , restricting eligibility to individuals with income below £11,800 or couples with income below £18,023, about 10 million people lost the payment. That included a million families in the poorest fifth of UK households, and 70% of pensioners with disabilities. The saving was estimated at £1.4bn a year. When Labour lost two-thirds of the council seats it was defending in the local elections this month, many in the party said the decision was one of the issues that came up most persistently with voters. Discussions were already under way about a change, Pippa Crerar and Jessica Elgot reported – but the electoral damage brought the issue into sharp focus. Now, after weeks of denial and evasion, Keir Starmer has finally acted. *** How the denials disappeared On the day the initial story was published, Labour’s denials were forthright . A government spokesperson told reporters that there “will not be a change to the government’s policy”; the health and social care secretary, Wes Streeting, insisted the threshold was not being reviewed, and that the measure was necessary “in order to deliver the change that people voted for”. Two Downing Street sources told HuffPost UK no review was under way. But by last weekend a different picture was emerging. The Sunday Times reported that the government was running focus groups on how voters would respond to possible changes, and quoted a No 10 source saying the issue was “more under discussion”. And in the following days, the language from ministers changed. Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said that the policy “stands” but refused to deny that a change was possible. Then Rachel Reeves said that she understood “the concerns that some people have about the level at which the winter fuel payment is removed” and added: “We’re always listening to these things.” On Tuesday, the BBC reported that a change was under consideration. Finally, Keir Starmer said at PMQs yesterday: “I recognise that people are still feeling the pressure of the cost of living crisis, including pensioners ... and that is why we want to ensure that ... more pensioners are eligible for winter fuel payment.” In this piece , Kiran Stacey sets out more detail on how the shift happened. “Some officials now say they felt they had to deny the reports until a decision was made in order to protect the chancellor’s authority,” he writes. “Others suggest that while there had been political discussions, the policy machine had not yet got up and running, and the denials softened once it was.” *** The economic backdrop Starmer has said the decision was possible because the economy is improving. He has some evidence to support his case: figures released earlier this week showed the UK economy growing by 0.7% in the first quarter of this year – slightly more than forecast and the highest rate in the G7. Recent deals with India, the US and the EU have further bolstered the government’s confidence, and tax revenues have also grown this year. But while the growth figures are relatively good news, they are not likely to be maintained: one of the key reasons for that is the ensuing arrival of Donald Trump’s tariffs, which were not a factor when the original cut was made. The deal with the EU is important, but it is only estimated to be worth about a 0.3% uptick in GDP by 2040. And in any case, the amount that will be spent on the changes to the winter fuel payment threshold is too small for a change in the economic outlook to be a serious factor. All of that suggests that this was, primarily, a political decision. *** What the change means in practice While Starmer’s announcement was significant, it was also short on detail. The government has not yet said how many of those who lost the payment will have it restored, or how eligibility will be measured. Officials fear that simply increasing the pension credit threshold to which it is currently linked will increase take-up of that benefit, thereby wiping out any potential savings, Pippa Crerar reported. The Resolution Foundation said that making those with incomes 20% above the pension credit threshold eligible would cost about £100m and make the payment available to 400,000 additional families. Nor is the announcement likely to have a rapid impact. It is a preview of a future decision, not a policy change today – and if done at the autumn budget it is not expected to come into force until winter 2026. *** The political fallout Kemi Badenoch and the Conservative-supporting media, unsurprisingly, sought to present the decision as a climbdown that indicates the government’s incompetence. Yesterday, Badenoch said the change was a “desperate” move and said that inflation has doubled since Starmer took office. (She also said that while the Tories would restore the payment to everyone earning up to £15,000, she wouldn’t raise taxes to pay for it, which is a useful reminder of the luxuries of opposition.) Labour MPs, on the other hand, welcomed the measure – not really as a political victory, but as a damage limitation exercise that will blunt attacks from other parties, and an answer for constituents who feel that the government has betrayed them. Expect to hear a lot of the framing that it is Labour’s sound economic management that has made the change possible, however dubious that claim may be. The decision is likely to only be a preview of some of the rough waters ahead for Starmer over government cuts. Next month, MPs will vote on separate cuts to disability benefits – as part of a welfare reform bill that an impact assessment estimated would result in an extra 250,000 people – 50,000 of them children – in relative poverty by the end of the decade. On Tuesday, the work and pensions secretary, Liz Kendall, insisted the changes were necessary to save the welfare state from collapse. But more than 100 Labour MPs have said they are not prepared to support the bill. This measure is in part intended to appease those would-be rebels – and ministers are expected to announce a child poverty package of up to £750m to win them over, too. In the meantime, even if Starmer’s announcement furnishes ministers with a more plausible answer to critical questions over the cost of living, there is little prospect of making the problem go away.

            "content": "Abra Lone District Rep. Joseph Bernos. (Photo from House of Representatives’ website) MANILA, Philippines — The review of the performances of cabinet officials of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. should also consider the national government’s partnerships with local government units (LGUs). This view comes from the League of Municipalities of the Philippines (LMP) amid the chief executive’s call for the resignation of all cabinet members. LMP, through its national president, Mayor JB Bernos of La Paz, Abra, said on Thursday that collaborations with LGUs should be a “key criterion in evaluating cabinet officials.’ “I unequivocally express my support to the President’s orders on behalf of the 1,486-strong League of Municipalities of the Philippines,” Bernos said in a statement. “If local government units conduct periodic performance reviews, so must the national government, especially those who are entrusted to bring the President’s vision to reality,” he noted. “The only thing I am asking the President is to also consider how much the Departments have collaborated or supported the municipalities in the past three (3) years,” he suggested. Bernos recently won the elections for the lone district of Abra. In a press release from the Presidential News Desk, Marcos said the results of the recently-concluded elections cannot be considered “business as usual.” He emphasized that the people expect better results. “It’s time to realign government with the people’s expectations,” he announced. READ: Marcos orders courtesy resignation of all Cabinet secretaries According to the president, officials “who have delivered and continue to deliver will be recognized.” At the same time, he told fellow public officials that government “cannot afford to be complacent.” On Monday, Marcos, in the inaugural episode of his podcast, said the elections gave him an idea that Filipinos are disappointed with the government. He said that his administration may have focused too much on big-ticket projects, leading to the neglect of small but important matters. “Nothing will happen in the Philippines. That’s as far as we’ll go. We won’t... we won’t rise. I said we need to change that,” the president observed. “So I looked at the big, difficult projects that will have long-term effects—those are the ones we should work on,” he explained. “So, we worked on it. That’s why the projects we made a priority were big ones—tourism, health—all major projects,” he recalled. “The problem with big projects, like transportation, for example, is that they really take time,” the president concluded. /apl Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

            "content": "Glamorous Democratic Rep. is accused of impaired driving after crashing into another car: 'I did nothing wrong' By SONYA GUGLIARA FOR DAILYMAIL.COM Published: 06:37, 22 May 2025 | Updated: 06:49, 22 May 2025 e-mail View comments A California senator has been accused of driving on drugs after crashing into another car just blocks away from the State Capitol in Sacramento. Sabrina Cervantes, 37, left her car behind and was driven to the hospital with minor injuries after the accident on Monday around 1:30pm. Sacramento police arrived to speak with the Democrat about what happened and quickly noticed she was showing signs of intoxication. After further evaluation, authorities cited the lawmaker with a misdemeanor for suspicion of DUI before she was released from the facility, police told KTLA . But the mother-of-three sitting on the Senate Committee on Elections fiercely denied she consumed any mind-altering substances before getting behind the wheel. 'On Monday afternoon, while seeking care in the emergency room after my sedan was t-boned by a large SUV,' she explained in a statement. 'I was accosted by Sacramento Police Department officers, falsely accused of driving under the influence, and involuntarily detained for several hours at the hospital.' She added these allegations have left her stressed and frustrated as someone who holds herself 'to the highest standard.' Sabrina Cervantes (pictured), 37, has been accused of driving on drugs after crashing into another car just blocks away from the State Capitol in Sacramento Cervantes (pictured) is the first openly gay Latina to represent Western Riverside County in the Legislature, her bio states 'I want to be clear: I did nothing wrong,' she asserted. 'The lab results I sought in the hospital show conclusively I had no alcohol in my system. I expect this to be quickly and justly resolved.' However, police reiterated the fact they are not claiming she was drunk, but on drugs. It is unclear what they believe she consumed. A spokesperson for the department also told KTLA Cervantes' argument that officers treated her unfairly or harshly was not supported by body camera video. 'After reviewing officers’ body camera footage, I didn’t see any indication Senator Cervantes was accosted by officers,' the representative said. 'Officers conducted a thorough investigation and remained professional and respectful throughout it.' The cause of the accident that sparked this DUI dilemma is still under investigation, although the spokesperson said it seemed that Cervantes' SUV was t-boned, as the politician claimed. Cervantes represents Senate District 31, which embodies portions of parts of Riverside and San Bernardino counties. She assumed the role in December 2024. Cervantes (pictured) represents Senate District 31, which embodies portions of parts of Riverside and San Bernardino counties. She assumed the role in December 2024 She previously served on the state's Assembly. She was first elected to the State Legislature in 2016, according to her Senate biography . From 2022 to 2024, she was the Chair of the California Latino Legislative Caucus. Cervantes is also the first openly gay Latina to represent Western Riverside County in the Legislature, her bio states. She earned a bachelor's degree in political science from the University of California, Riverside before completing an executive education program at Harvard University. Cervantes' scandal comes months after a Democratic Rhode Island senator was arrested for allegedly drunk driving . Progressive state Rep. Enrique Sanchez, 28, was pulled over in the early morning hours of February 3, after allegedly parking his car in an intersection in Cranston, Rhode Island. Police officers noticed he remained stopped at a traffic light even after the light turned green, as reported by the Rhode Island Current. Officer Chavelle Lopez wrote in the arrest report that Sanchez 'seemed confused' when stopped, initially handing over a red debit card instead of his driver's license before insisting he hadn't been drinking. But the mother-of-three (middle) sitting on the Senate Committee on Elections fiercely denied she consumed any mind-altering substances before getting behind the wheel. Cervantes' scandal comes months after a Democratic Rhode Island Senator Enrique Sanchez (pictured) was arrested for allegedly drunk driving She noted she could smell 'a heavy odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath' while Sanchez was speaking and observed he had 'bloodshot watery eyes.' Despite the evidence, Sanchez pleaded not guilty to driving while intoxicated in his initial court appearance. He since pleaded not guilty to lesser civil charges of refusing a chemical test and failure to obey traffic control devices. Court documents obtained by Fox News reveal that on February 19, Cranston Magistrate William Noonan suspended Sanchez's license but granted him a limited 'hardship license.' The 'hardship license' allowed him to drive to his day job and the State House between 8am and 8pm - but only after installing an ignition interlock breathalyzer in his vehicle.

Expressing confidence of faster growth and better results, Willis announced a slew of measures. These includes tax cuts, higher spendings on health, education and defence.",
            "content": "New Zealand Finance Minister Nicola Willis presented the country's annual budget on Thursday (May 22) in Parliament. Presented in the back drop of a poor economic performance in 2024 and the tariff wars unleashed by US President Donald Trump, Willis did not splurge as she kept new spendings for the 2025 fiscal year at its lowest in a decadeWhile expressing confidence that the budget will support New Zealand's economic recovery now underway , she stated that the proposals take a longer-term view with an aim to boost future investment, savings and growth. Admitting that the last few years have been tough for New Zealand's economy Willis promised that her budget will help in faster growth, more jobs and increased wages.However, she also added that the Budget is not a cure for all the economic problems the country is dealing with at present. But we do promise that the decisions we are taking now will set our country up for a better future, she said in her speech.Also Read: Budget highlights: KiwiSaver changes, business tax breaks, and increased spending on health and educationHighlighting the last few years which have not been rosy economically for the Kiwis, the minister infused some good news with her claims that the country is on the path of recovery aided by strong economic and fiscal management. The recovery is being supported by lower interest rates and a strong export performance, she stated in her speech.Touching upon the US President's new economic outlook without mentioning his name, she stressed, Recent tariff announcements have created uncertainty and volatility around the world. For a small trading nation like New Zealand, the global situation is concerning. It doesn’t threaten the recovery, but it does threaten the pace of the recovery. Read Full Budget Speech of Nicola WillisMr Speaker,I move that the Appropriation (2025/26 Estimates) Bill be now read a second time.Ahumairangi, Tangi Te Keo, tū te ao tū te pō. Te Whanganui-a-Tara, te karu waitai, piata mai nā. Kei oku nui kei aku rahi, nōku te hōnore ki te whakamaunu i te tahua mō te tau nei, tēnā koutou katoa. Mr Speaker,As I said in te reo Māori, it is an honour to announce this year’s Budget.This is a responsible Budget to secure New Zealand’s future.It supports the economic recovery now underway.It also takes a longer-term view, with initiatives to boost future investment, savings and growth.It continues this Government’s investment in health, education, and law and order.And, in a challenging global environment, it provides funding to boost New Zealand’s defence capability.It does all of this within an expenditure track that reduces government spending as a share of the economy, returns the government’s books to balance, and bends the debt curve from going up to going down.The economic outlook presented alongside this Budget is a bright one.After a tough few years, growth, jobs and wages are set to rise.The Government is not promising that today’s Budget will solve all New Zealanders’ problems.But we do promise that the decisions we are taking now will set our country up for a better future.Mr Speaker,The creation and delivery of an annual Budget is at the heart of strong and stable government.This Budget is a team effort.I want to acknowledge and thank the Associate Ministers of Finance David Seymour, Shane Jones and Chris Bishop for their ideas and advice.They were heavily involved in putting this Budget together, as was the Prime Minister, whose leadership and wise counsel was invaluable. Thank you, Prime Minister.Mr Speaker,In recent years, New Zealanders have battled through an extended period of high inflation, high interest rates and low growth.We know that times remain tough for many Kiwis.The good news is that – with strong economic and fiscal management – a recovery is underway.The recovery is being supported by lower interest rates and a strong export performance.And over the next few years, the Government’s new Investment Boost policy – which I will come to shortly – will have a positive impact on growth.Recent tariff announcements have created uncertainty and volatility around the world.For a small trading nation like New Zealand, the global situation is concerning.It doesn’t threaten the recovery, but it does threaten the pace of the recovery.The Treasury has pegged its forecasts back and downside risks remain.Despite this, Budget forecasts show economic growth picking up to healthy levels.Real GDP growth is expected to accelerate to 2.9 per cent in 2025/26 and 3 per cent in the year after. Growth matters. It means more jobs, higher incomes and opportunities for families to get ahead.Over the forecast period, wages are expected to grow faster than inflation and, at the end of that period, there are expected to be 240,000 more people in jobs.Mr Speaker,The government’s books have taken a hammering over the past six years or so.Spending has risen sharply. So has government debt.The Budget deficit left by the previous Government is structural – it is not simply due to the state of the economy.In other words, the last Government was living beyond its means – loading up the credit card to pay for things New Zealand couldn’t afford. This did real damage to the economy, as a massive spike in the cost of living led to high interest rates and low growth.This Government is taking responsibility for cleaning up the mess. Under our fiscal management, Government debt will stabilise, then start to come down.And our control of spending creates room for monetary policy to respond with lower interest rates.There is no doubt that fiscal consolidation is challenging.Some would do it with higher taxes.That would burden New Zealand workers and businesses, and scare away talent and investment. It would put our economic recovery at risk. This Government is taking a different approach – we are getting the books in balance by controlling growth in government spending.The operating allowance for Budget 2025 is $1.3 billion on average per annum.This is the lowest allowance in a decade, significantly down from the $2.4 billion allowance signalled in the Budget Policy Statement in December.That reduction of $1.1 billion goes straight to the bottom line. The Government’s headline operating balance indicator, OBEGALx, is $1.1 billion better each year, on average, than it otherwise would have been.In addition, the Treasury estimates that the tighter Budget package will see interest rates being 30 basis points lower than they otherwise would have been by the end of the forecast period.Importantly, that $1.3 billion allowance is a net figure.On the one hand, it encompasses $5 billion a year of new spending and $1.7 billion a year for Investment Boost. On the other hand, it contains savings of $5.3 billion a year.These savings are the result of ongoing efforts by multiple Ministers. We take seriously our roles as custodians of taxpayers’ money.A significant portion of those savings come from changes to the pay equity regime.The changes were made to ensure future settlements stick to correcting pay discrepancies that arise from sex-based discrimination, and not for other reasons.Making those changes means the Government can re-purpose $2.7 billion a year, on average, towards Budget priorities like health, education, and law and order.That $2.7 billion had been put aside in contingencies for what, under the previous regime, were expected to be very wide-ranging pay equity claims, increasingly divorced from the sex-based discrimination that pay equity is supposed to be about. A one-off $1.8 billion has also been repurposed from previous contingencies and put towards capital expenditure in this Budget, supporting investments in new hospitals, schools and other infrastructure.I can assure Members that adequate funding remains in contingency to meet potential costs of future public sector pay equity settlements under the new regime.And the Government anticipates there will be pay rises in female-dominated public-sector workforces achieved through normal collective bargaining. The Government has also been able to find net savings by increasing funding for Inland Revenue’s compliance activities. Funding of $35 million a year is expected to result in $280 million of extra tax revenue – an 8 to 1 return on investment. This was an initiative proposed last Budget by New Zealand First and expanded in Budget 2025.Further savings have been made by closing a number of tagged contingencies and from reviewing the value for money of grants and funds across government.This is not austerity – far from it. In fact, it is what you do to avoid austerity.Getting the books in shape ensures New Zealand has financial security and choices in the future.As I am about to set out, savings in this Budget have allowed us to make much-needed investments in health, education, law and order, and rebuilding our Defence Force.Budget forecasts show that core Crown expenses are expected to remain steady, then decline as a percentage of GDP, reaching 30.9 per cent by 2028/29.The OBEGALx deficit is expected to widen in the near term, then gradually improve after next year, returning to a surplus of $200 million by the end of the forecast period.At that point, the structural deficit the previous Government left us will have been eliminated.Net core Crown debt is expected to peak at 46 per cent of GDP – slightly lower than forecast at the Half Year Update – before beginning to decline.As these forecasts show, the Government is taking a deliberate, medium-term approach to fiscal consolidation.I am aware there are alternative approaches.Some say we should keep on borrowing forever – whack it on the credit card and hope for the best.That would be the height of irresponsibility. It would put the financial security of New Zealand at risk.We owe better to our kids.And to my own kids, sitting in the gallery today, I want to say that Mum’s been busy lately.But your future, and the future of the next generation of New Zealanders, has been very much on my mind as we’ve put this Budget together.Mr Speaker,New Zealand’s productivity challenges are well understood.Study after study has identified a low level of capital investment per worker, compared to other countries.To raise productivity, lift incomes and drive long-term economic growth, New Zealand needs businesses, big and small, to invest in machinery, tools, equipment, technology, vehicles, industrial buildings, and other capital assets.Investment Boost is a new tax incentive that will increase capital investment in New Zealand.Investment Boost allows a business to immediately deduct 20 per cent of the cost of a new asset from its taxable income, on top of depreciation. This means a much lower tax bill in the year of purchase.The remaining book value is depreciated at normal rates.Since a dollar now is more valuable than a future dollar, the cashflow from investments is more attractive and the after-tax returns are better.More investment opportunities stack up financially, so more will be made.Over 20 years, Investment Boost is expected to lift New Zealand’s capital stock by 1.6 per cent, GDP by 1 per cent and wages by 1.5 per cent.These are orders of magnitude, not precise values. But officials estimate that roughly half the impacts happen in the first five years.Investment Boost starts today and applies to new assets purchased in New Zealand as well as assets imported from overseas.It includes commercial buildings but excludes land, residential buildings, and assets already in use in New Zealand.There’s no cap on the value of new investments and all businesses, regardless of size, are eligible.It is estimated to cost an average of $1.7 billion per year in reduced revenue across the forecast period.To manufacturers, farmers, tradies and other Kiwi businesses, my message to you is this – our Government is helping you invest for your future and our country’s future.Mr Speaker,Continuing the growth theme, Budget 2025 funds a number of initiatives that contribute to the Government’s going for growth agenda.As I announced earlier this week, the Government has set aside $65 million to encourage foreign investment in New Zealand infrastructure, by increasing the amount of tax-deductible debt foreign investors can use to fund it.The Budget also supports the science and innovation reforms announced earlier this year. These include the move to transform Crown Research Institutes into three new public research organisations, establishing a dedicated gene technology regulator, and creating a new agency – Invest New Zealand – as the Government’s one-stop-shop for foreign direct investment.Other economic growth initiatives in this Budget include funding for screen production rebates, and additional funding for the Elevate NZ Venture Fund to invest in the technology start-up sector.Funding has also been set aside in contingency for potential Crown co-investment in new gas fields to ensure future supply.Mr Speaker,While KiwiSaver has helped a lot of New Zealanders to save, many people’s balances are modest.There would be few people who reach 65, look at their KiwiSaver balance and think “I wish I had saved less”.The same goes for those looking to buy their first home.Budget 2025 makes changes to encourage Kiwis to save more, while also making the scheme more fiscally sustainable.From 1 April 2026, the default rate of employee and employer contributions, which is currently 3 per cent, will go to 3.5 per cent. From 1 April 2028, it will go to 4 per cent.Phasing this in over a three-year period helps workers and employers plan ahead.The Government recognises that, over time, employer contributions may effectively form part of the wage negotiation process.Employees will be able to opt down to the current 3 per cent rate and still be matched by their employer at that lower rate.Their contributions will be reset to the default rate after 12 months, but they can opt down again if they wish.These changes – moving to a default contribution rate of 4 per cent but retaining a 3 per cent option – were also recommended last year by the Retirement Commissioner.From 1 April 2026, the Government will extend employer matching to 16- and 17- year-olds. And from 1 July 2025, it will make them eligible for the government contribution.This will encourage more young people to adopt a savings habit and help them build a deposit for their first home.Members may recall that the original KiwiSaver design included layers of expensive government subsidies that proved unaffordable.Most have since been wound back, apart from the government contribution, which is expected to cost an average of $1.2 billion a year over the forecast period.I am advised that the government contribution is unlikely to be increasing the amount New Zealanders save.To ensure that KiwiSaver’s costs to the taxpayer remain sustainable, this annual government contribution will be halved to 25 cents for each dollar a member contributes each year, up to a maximum government contribution of just over $260.Members with an income of more than $180,000 will no longer receive any government contribution.These changes to the government contribution will apply from 1 July 2025.They do not affect the current year’s government contribution, which will be paid out in July and August this year.Putting all these changes together, the KiwiSaver balances of employees contributing at the new default rate will grow faster than they do at the current 3 per cent default rate, providing a larger balance at age 65 or when people come to buy their first home.Savings from changes to the government contribution – which total $2.5 billion over the forecast period – are being used to fund other Budget priorities like health, education, and law and order.Mr Speaker,A number of Budget 2025 initiatives deliver targeted cost of living support.These include fiscally neutral changes to Working for Families to better target low- and middle-income families.From 1 April next year, the Government will raise the family income threshold for Working for Families to $44,900 a year and increase the abatement rate slightly to 27.5 per cent.As a result, families with incomes just above the new threshold will get an extra $23 per fortnight from Working for Families, with this additional support reducing gradually as family income rises.In all, an estimated 142,000 families with children will receive $14 more per fortnight on average, and the vast majority of these families will have incomes below $100,000 a year. The cost of this extra support is met from better targeting the first year of the Best Start tax credit.From 1 April next year, the first year of Best Start will no longer be universal but will be income tested the same way the second and third years are, with payments ending completely when a family earns just over $97,000 a year.As a consequence, there will be families that receive less financial support than they otherwise would have, but the vast majority of these will have incomes over $100,000 a year.The change to Best Start only applies for births on or after 1 April 2026, so no family will see an actual reduction in their payments. And, as a mother of four, I can point out that we are giving prospective parents more than 9 months’ advance notice of this change.Mr Speaker,Another cost-of-living initiative relates to prescriptions.Getting a prescription for only three months at a time can be frustrating for people on stable, long-term medications like asthma inhalers, insulin for diabetes and blood pressure tablets.Getting a repeat prescription costs money and adds paperwork for doctors.Now, from the first quarter of 2026, New Zealanders will be able to get 12-month prescriptions for their medicines.That will save Kiwis medical costs, and it will give health professionals more time to deal with other patients.The Budget also helps up to 66,000 additional SuperGold cardholders pay their rates.From 1 July this year, the rates rebate scheme will become more generous for SuperGold cardholders and their households, by increasing the income abatement threshold to $45,000 a year and increasing the maximum rebate to $805.These changes originated from the National and New Zealand First coalition agreement and will come as a welcome relief to many ratepayers.Mr Speaker,The biggest part of the Budget is investment in frontline services Kiwis rely on.I want to take Members through some key areas of new funding.First, let me clarify that when I talk about additional funding, I am referring – unless stated otherwise – to operating funding over the next four years, plus capital funding.I will start with health.Budget 2025 makes a capital investment of more than $1 billion in hospitals and health facilities.Funding has been allocated for a major redevelopment of Nelson Hospital, including a new 128-bed inpatient building. In what is great news for the people of Nelson, the new inpatient building is expected to be built by 2029 – two years earlier than originally planned.Funding has also been allocated for a new emergency department at Wellington Regional Hospital.In addition, Wellington Hospital will get new specialist treatment spaces, an expansion of the intensive care unit and a refurbishment of the old children’s hospital.The Budget also funds infrastructure projects at Auckland City Hospital, Greenlane Clinical Centre and Palmerston North Hospital.In terms of operating funding, the Budget confirms a funding increase of $5.5 billion – previously signalled in last year’s Budget – for hospital and specialist services, primary care, community health and public health.This will support Health New Zealand to make progress on the Government’s targets for more timely care, including shorter waiting times for hip replacements, cataract surgery and other elective procedures.Budget 2025 confirms funding of over $1 billion to buy and deliver additional cancer treatments and other medicines Pharmac has announced over the past 12 months.And the Budget provides new funding of $447 million to support increased access to primary care, including urgent care and after-hours services across New Zealand.Mr Speaker,Giving children a chance to reach their potential through the power of a good education is one of the greatest gifts a government can bestow.And to my mind, improving the results we get from our education system is the single most important thing we can do to improve the future productivity of New Zealand.New funding in Budget 2025 of $646 million operating, and $101 million capital, is the largest boost to learning support in a generation.It will change the lives of children who need extra support to learn because of physical, behavioural, communication or other learning challenges.It will also benefit their classmates, whose teachers will now be better supported to meet diverse learning needs.Children with additional needs have enormous potential and, with this support, more of them will have the chance to realise it.The extra Budget funding will provide more teacher aide hours, more specialist support, learning support coordinators, an expansion of early intervention services, and new learning support classrooms.There is also new funding in the Budget for schools’ operational grants, early childhood education and tertiary education subsidies. And there is funding to increase the independent schools’ subsidy to address price and volume pressures over time, delivering on the ACT and National coalition commitment to review the funding formula.Extra maths help will be available for students who need it, with $100 million of new funding for early intervention and support. There is a $140 million package of services to lift school attendance, and this delivers on another ACT and National coalition commitment.Finally, more than $700 million has been set aside to deliver new schools, purchase sites, expand some schools and build new classrooms.Mr Speaker.New funding in Budget 2025 continues the Government’s drive to restore law and order.The Budget invests $480 million to support Police on the frontline to crack down on crime and keep communities safe.We are also keeping communities safe through stronger sentencing laws that mean less violent crime, fewer victims and more offenders in prison.The Budget invests $472 million to ensure Corrections can manage this increase in the prison population, including 580 new frontline staff. This reflects an ACT and National coalition commitment to increase funding to ensure sufficient prison capacity.The Government is also redeveloping Christchurch Men’s Prison, with the project set to be designed, built, financed, and maintained for 25 years under a public-private partnership.Court case backlogs will be reduced through $246 million of new funding, which will improve timeliness and access to justice. Customs is also receiving additional funding to strengthen our border, prevent drug smuggling and fight organised crime.Finally, I want to mention Māori and Pasifika Wardens, and the Māori Women’s Welfare League. They are the friendly faces when things get tough, and they are receiving funding in this Budget thanks to New Zealand First. Mr Speaker,For too long, New Zealand’s Defence Force has been allowed to gradually deteriorate through loss of personnel and a failure to upgrade equipment.Budget 2025 marks a change in that course.A major uplift in defence spending will ensure New Zealand pulls its weight in an increasingly volatile world.It does this by investing in the men and women of our military and the modern tools they need to do their jobs.This uplift cannot be funded in one Budget alone.But we have made a meaningful start by funding priority projects including new maritime helicopters.The Budget also invests $660 million to improve core Defence Force capabilities across air, sea, land and cyberspace.In terms of foreign affairs, the Budget addresses a very steep fiscal cliff in Official Development Assistance, specifically for climate finance, that was unhelpfully left behind by the previous Government.The Budget addresses this, at least in part, through ongoing, baselined funding of $100 million a year, focused on the Pacific. Members will not be surprised to know that the Minister of Foreign Affairs has made a case for more funding, and this will be looked at in future Budgets.The Budget also includes new funding of $84 million over four years to enhance New Zealand’s relationships with Asian countries, address trade barriers and support the Government’s goal to double exports.Mr Speaker,Budget 2025 sets aside $230 million for a new Social Investment Fund, of which $190 million is to purchase better outcomes for New Zealanders in need.Social investment is about the government investing earlier, guided by data and evidence, and with more transparent measurement of the impact that interventions are having in people’s lives. Over the next year, the Fund will invest in at least 20 initiatives, adopting a very different contracting approach than is traditionally used by government agencies.I know the Minister for Social Investment is excited by the prospects for this approach to change vulnerable people’s lives for the better.Mr Speaker,As announced a fortnight ago, the Budget allocates $774 million to fund initiatives in response to the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Abuse in Care.The Government has committed this funding, across a number of different votes, to improve redress for survivors and strengthen the care system to prevent, identify, and respond to abuse in the future.Mr Speaker,Budget 2025 allocates $6.8 billion of capital expenditure.This is partially offset by savings, leaving a net capital allowance in the Budget of $4 billion, slightly higher than the $3.625 billion capital allowance signalled in the Budget Policy Statement.I have already mentioned most areas of new capital expenditure in the Budget – hospitals, schools, the Defence Force, prisons, and the Elevate Fund.Budget 2025 also provides new funding to improve New Zealand’s rail network. Train commuters and businesses moving goods around the country will see more reliable rail services thanks to the Government’s investment of $605 million for rail upgrades and renewals.In addition, the Budget provides funding to deliver additional social homes and affordable rentals, including for whānau Māori.These Budget 2025 capital initiatives add to existing investments already underway. Government infrastructure investment over the forecast period now totals around $61.8 billion.About a third of this investment in infrastructure will be spent on the transport sector and another third is going to education and health. In addition, $3.5 billion has been set aside in each of the next three Budgets for new capital investments.Mr Speaker,Putting this Budget together wasn’t easy. It involved careful choices and restraint from all Ministers.That is as it should be, and as New Zealanders have the right to expect.Budget 2025 strikes a careful balance.It invests in public services New Zealand needs now, while driving long-term reforms to lift investment and productivity.It delivers new hospitals, new schools and a huge boost to learning support.It makes changes to encourage Kiwis to save more.It provides cost of living relief targeted at low- and middle-income families.It takes the first step in a major uplift in defence spending.It secures the economic recovery Kiwis depend on.And – as all New Zealanders should expect – it does this while setting a course to a balanced budget and an end to rising debt.Our approach means New Zealanders can look forward with confidence.Every Kiwi can know that this is a Government that has their back.Mr Speaker,I commend this Budget to the House.",

            "content": "Former governor of Jigawa State, Sule Lamido, has claimed that erstwhile president Goodluck Jonathan targeted his family while he was in power.Lamido stated that he warned Jonathan that he would pay for the pain inflicted on his family by his administration.He disclosed this in an excerpt from his autobiography, “Being True to Myself”, released on May 13.The former governor recounted how his son was arrested at Aminu Kano International Airport while accompanying his daughter to Cairo for medical treatment.He described the arrest as part of a campaign by Jonathan’s government to target him and his family.Lamido claimed that his travails under the Jonathan-led government began in 2014 after former President Olusegun Obasanjo encouraged him to contest the 2015 presidential election.In Chapter 11 of the book, titled “Goodluck Jonathan Succeeds Yar’Adua,” Lamido alleged that his son was blackmailed after being accused of laundering the sum of $50,000.“It was on the third leg of the trip that he was arrested for carrying $50,000 on him. He was with a family consisting of himself, his wife, his sick daughter, and her nanny. The money was meant for their upkeep and medical treatment, but he had custody of it.“It was all a set-up. By the following day, The Pilot newspaper, owned by President Jonathan and published by one Dennis, splashed the news on its front page that my son had been caught with N30bn cash attempting to launder it for me. And it was the only paper that published the story.”Lamido said the aim was to tarnish his image and morally silence him. As a result, he said he met with then-President Jonathan, expressed his dissatisfaction, and issued a stern warning.According to him,“How can you use your presidential power to punish me simply because someone mentioned to you that I wanted to rule Nigeria? That shouldn’t be a reason to destroy my own son. His daughter was first taken to Egypt for medical treatment when she was only fourteen days old“The parents were asked to bring her back after three months and had to return again. On their third trip, to undergo the final operation, my son was arrested, and the $50,000 found on him was for medical treatment and the upkeep of all four of them. Sir, do you think $50,000 is enough to destroy the Nigerian economy?“I felt we needed to reflect on the past, so I also said to him: Sir, as the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, I know much about the $1.2bn Malabu Oil scandal. How can my son’s BTA, meant for the treatment of his sick daughter, destroy the country’s economy?”Lamido noted that although he did not intend to threaten Jonathan, he felt it necessary to speak frankly about the reality of the situation.He said he told Jonathan that, as a Fulani man, he would make him pay for the pain inflicted on his family.As narrated in the book, Lamido told Jonathan, “Sir, I want you to know that I am extremely hurt because you are trying to destroy my reputation and that of my family. I am not angry, but if I react in anger, it may cause problems for our party, the PDP, which I helped to found. I will not do anything that will pull it down.“But Sir, I want you to note that I am a Fulani man, and we have a reputation for our long memory. One day, I will take my own pound of flesh for the pain you have caused me and my family. I assure you of that.”According to Lamido, his words appeared to have shocked Jonathan, who immediately responded, “Jigawa, I will give your son a state pardon.”He said this response made him even angrier.“I said to him in utter disbelief: Is that so? So, the whole incident was really planned? You are confirming that to me now by your remark.“My son is being convicted and fined. We are now at the appeal stage; when we lose, we go to the Supreme Court, and when we lose again, then you will grant him a state pardon. Is it all a deliberate arrangement? Now I can see through it all. Believe me, you are going to pay for it.”Lamido said he left Jonathan angry and likely confused, even as he reflected deeply on the encounter.The post I Told Jonathan He Would Pay For The Pain Inflicted On My Family – Lamido appeared first on Naija News.",

Former showjumper Mikaela Cojuangco Jaworski officially took over during the visit from IOC President-elect Kirsty Coventry as chair of the commission, which oversees preparations for the Games on behalf of the Olympic movement. \"Through our regular engagement with the organising committee, we are confident that Brisbane 2032 is on the right path,\" Jaworski told a news conference in Brisbane. \"This week gave us meaningful opportunity to witness progress firsthand and to reaffirm our commitment to Games that will leave a lasting legacy for the community and place Brisbane confidently on the world stage.\" Jaworski said the example of the legacies for Melbourne and Sydney when those cities hosted the Games in 1956 and 2000 should convince waverers in Brisbane of how beneficial the Olympics would be for the city. \"Melbourne has hosted, and Sydney has hosted, and there's certainly legacy there,\" she said. \"There's a lot of goodwill globally remembering these cities as hosts, and I think we can count on Brisbane ... being brought to the world stage (if) we have a successful Games.\" Since the last meeting of the coordination commission, the Queensland government has published its third, and what it says will be the final, venue plan for the Games. Despite bid commitments on sustainability in line with the IOC's \"New Norm\" reforms for host cities, the plan included the building of a new Olympic stadium and a national aquatics centre in an inner city Brisbane park. \"When you talk about the 'New Norm', I think one of the key things is about the Games being part of the city or the host,\" Jaworski said in answering a question about the changes. \"It's not about turning the host into what the Games need, but the other way around. So it is unique.\" CREATE CERTAINTY Local organising committee chief Andrew Liveris said it had been a relief to finally get a plan in place his team could enact, even if he did not think any ground would be broken on the big new venues until the end of 2026. \"I haven't been able to wipe the smile off my face (since the announcement),\" he said. \"I love to plan and implement. It's really hard to plan when the plan keeps moving on you, right? So our job now is to create certainty out of this plan. There's work to do on that. \"We're not out of the woods completely, but we are mostly out of the woods, and we have certainty around some pretty big decisions.\" Liveris said all the venues needed to be completed at least a year before the start of the Games and accepted that issues of labour shortages in Australia's construction industry and local building constraints were a concern. \"We are part of a bigger problem, and one that has to be solved by the current (Queensland) government,\" Liveris said. \"They're very dedicated to doing it.\" (Reporting by Nick Mulvenney, editing by Peter Rutherford)",

            "content": "SINGAPORE, May 22 (Reuters) - Foreign investors could once barely imagine that China would invade neighbouring Taiwan, but with Donald Trump as president of the United States, many view it as a tail-risk scenario they must prepare for, although they cannot find ways to do so. The democratically-governed island has long been a point of contention in U.S.-China relations, which have worsened since Trump entered the White House in January and launched trade tariffs that have rattled markets. Sign up here. Investors fear that if China attempts to take over what it considers \"sacred\" territory, it risks a war that ushers in the end of Taiwan as a market with its own currency and identity, while the only other alternative is peace and the status quo. For investors, the choice therefore is to stay out completely or stay invested and hope for the best. The risk of any invasion is difficult to hedge, said Mukesh Dave, chief investment officer at Aravali Asset Management, a global arbitrage fund based in Singapore. \"You can't settle any trades, the currency might disappear altogether,\" he said. \"You either carry on like it's business as usual, or stay away.\" The odds of China invading Taiwan have risen to 12% on betting platform Polymarket from close to none earlier this year. Skittish foreign investors have pulled nearly $11 billion out of Taiwan stocks this year, although much of that was fuelled by concerns over tariffs and the economy and they made a tentative return in May. The benchmark index (.TWII) , opens new tab is down 6% this year. While the United States has long stuck to a policy of \"strategic ambiguity,\" on Taiwan, not making clear whether it would respond militarily to an attack, Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden, said during his time in office that U.S. forces would defend the island if China were to attack. Rising geopolitical tensions from Trump's talk of a new global order and his disregard for Russia's takeover of swathes of Ukraine have raised doubts about such U.S. protection for Taiwan. While Taiwan has lived under the threat of Chinese invasion since 1949 when the defeated Republic of China government fled there after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong's communists, the two sides have not exchanged shots in anger for decades. Yet, tension has simmered across the Taiwan Strait that separates the island from China. China's two-day war games around Taiwan in April further fuelled investor worries. The latest barbs came this week as Taiwan President Lai Ching-te used a news conference marking his first year in office to pledge peace with China, only to have China's Taiwan Affairs Office say his remarks were a \"two-faced tactic\" and that Taiwan cannot \"stop the inevitable trend of national reunification\". Lai, whom China calls a \"separatist\", rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, saying only the island's people can decide their future. Goldman Sachs' Cross-Strait Risk Index, which gauges the intensity of geopolitical risk by counting the number of news articles mentioning tension, has been rising since Trump won the U.S. election last year. \"If aggression toward Taiwan occurs, the investment decision becomes binary: stay exposed and absorb extreme volatility, or exit swiftly to preserve capital,\" said Steve Lawrence, chief investment officer of Balfour Capital Group. The Taiwan investment rationale centres on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) (2330.TW) , opens new tab , , the world's largest contract chipmaker and the semiconductor industry's crown jewel. TSMC, which counts Nvidia (NVDA.O) , opens new tab and Apple (AAPL.O) , opens new tab as major clients and whose stock is listed in Taipei and New York, powered the stock market to record highs earlier this year. \"TSMC is so big that the expectation among investors is the United States will defend Taiwan, and defend it strongly,\" said Dave of Aravali. \"That is the hope.\" Yet TSMC has been in Trump's crosshairs as he unleashed tariffs in April and later delayed some duties to negotiate with foes and allies alike. Local fund managers say while there may be no way for investors to hedge against an actual war, they do have options to hedge against possible market declines driven by fear of war. However, Li Fang-kuo, chairman of Uni-President’s (1216.TW) , opens new tab securities investment advisory unit in Taiwan, is sceptical of the need for such hedging, as he believes foreign investors are misreading the level of risk of a cross-strait war. \"We shouldn't interpret it from a geopolitical risk perspective. The key issue is the tariffs.\" Rich Nuzum, global chief investment strategist at pension fund adviser Mercer, said his clients that have looked at the risk found the best option was to diversify. \"I think stress-testing for crisis is being done more and more.\" Reporting by Ankur Banerjee, Rae Wee, Tom Westbrook and Vidya Ranganathan in Singapore, Faith Hung in Taipei;Editing by Vidya Ranganathan and Clarence Fernandez Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tab",

            "content": "Tourism Secretary Christina Frasco — File photo MANILA, Philippines — Department of Tourism (DOT) Secretary Christina Frasco has submitted her courtesy resignation on Thursday, adhering to the order of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Frasco, in her letter, asked Marcos to accept her resignation, saying that it is a reflection of her support for his administration’s policy to “put the people first.” “It has been an honor and privilege to have served our country,” Frasco told the President. “Under your leadership, we have worked to transform tourism to be more than just travel, but a unifying force for good, creating jobs, honoring our culture, and helping communities thrive,” she added. “With Your Excellency’s support, the tourism sector has significantly contributed to the national economy and provided jobs and livelihood for millions of Filipinos,” the DOT chief also said. Frasco said her resignation came with gratitude, as she mentioned that she gave her all —“with full devotion to our country, and with fervent hope that tourism will continue to be a force for unity and progress.” Marcos ordered on Thursday the courtesy resignation of all of his Cabinet secretaries, days after the 2025 midterm elections. He asserted that “it is not business.” “The people have spoken, and they expect results, not politics, not excuses. We hear them, and we will act,” Marcos said.

            "description": "Barron Trump, the youngest of the Trump family, has captured public attention due to his towering height, sparking widespread curiosity and speculation. While sources vary, he is estimated to be between 6 feet 7 inches and 6 feet 9 inches, surpassing his father and siblings. This makes him taller than even Abraham Lincoln, the tallest U.S. president.",
            "content": "Barron Trump (File Image) There is no doubt that Barron Trump, the 18-year-old son of Donald and Melania Trump, is the tallest among his family members. Following his mother's social media post showing the 18-year-old at the voting booth during Election Day 2024, public interest in his height increased significantly. Current internet searches indicate Barron stands at 6 feet, 9 inches. However, during his graduation ceremony at Oxbridge Academy in West Palm Beach in May, reports suggested he measured 6 feet, 7 inches. Although male height typically stabilises post-puberty at approximately age 18, some individuals continue growing into their early twenties. According to Google, Barron Trump's height matches that of NBA player LeBron James at 6-foot-7. This makes him the tallest amongst his siblings and taller than his father, who measures 6 feet, 3 inches. His mother, who previously worked as a model, is 5-foot-11. His half-brothers measure differently, with Eric Trump at 6-5 and Donald Trump Jr. at 6-1. Is he taller than all the presidents? --Check heights of bush, Obama, Clinton And the answer to this question is yes. The most tallest president is Abraham Lincoln, whose height was 6ft 4 inches and he is 5 inches taller than him. After Lincoln, it was Lyndon Baines Johnson, whose height was 6ft 3 and the half inch. Both are the only Presidents taller than Donald Trump. Bill Clinton, 42nd US President, was 6ft and two and the half inches tall, while George HW Bush, 41st US President was 6ft and 2 inches. while Barack Obama, who was the 44th president, was 6ft and one and the half inches tall.",

Tens of thousands of panicked tourists left Kashmir within days after the rare killings of tourists on April 22 at a picture-perfect meadow in southern resort town of Pahalgam. Following the attack, authorities temporarily closed dozens of tourist resorts in the region, adding to fear and causing occupancy rates to plummet. Graphic images, repeatedly circulated through TV channels and social media, deepened panic and anger. India blamed Pakistan for supporting the attackers, a charge Islamabad denied. Those who had stayed put fled soon after tensions between India and Pakistan spiked. As the two countries fired missiles and drones at each other, the region witnessed mass cancellations of tourist bookings. New Delhi and Islamabad reached a U.S.-mediated ceasefire on May 10 but hardly any new bookings have come in, tour operators said. Sheikh Bashir Ahmed, vice president of the Kashmir Hotel and Restaurant Association, said at least 12,000 rooms in the region’s hundreds of hotels and guesthouses were previously booked until June. Almost all bookings have been cancelled, and tens of thousands of people associated with hotels are without jobs, he said. “It’s a huge loss.” Ahmed said. The decline has had a ripple effect on the local economy. Handicrafts, food stalls and taxi operators have lost most of their business. Idyllic destinations, like the resort towns of Gulmarg and Pahalgam, once a magnet for travelers, are eerily silent. Lines of colorful hand-carved boats, known as shikaras, lie deserted, mostly anchored still on Srinagar’s normally bustling Dal Lake. Tens of thousands of daily wage workers have hardly any work. “There used to be long lines of tourists waiting for boat rides. There are none now,” said boatman Fayaz Ahmed. Taxi driver Mohammed Irfan would take tourists for long drives to hill stations and show them grand Mughal-era gardens. “Even a half day of break was a luxury, and we would pray for it. Now, my taxi lies standstill for almost two weeks,” he said. In recent years, the tourism sector grew substantially, making up about 7% of the region’s economy, according to official figures. Omar Abdullah, Kashmir’s top elected official, said before the attack on tourists that the government was aiming to increase tourism’s share of the economy to at least 15% in the next four to five years. Indian-controlled Kashmir was a top destination for visitors until the armed rebellion against Indian rule began in 1989. Warfare laid waste to the stunningly beautiful region, which is partly controlled by Pakistan and claimed by both countries in its entirety. As the conflict ground on, the tourism sector slowly revived but occasional military skirmishes between India and Pakistan kept visitors at bay. But India vigorously pushed tourism after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government scrapped the disputed region’s semi-autonomy in 2019. Tensions have simmered, but the region has also drawn millions of visitors amid a strange calm enforced by an intensified security crackdown. According to official data, close to 3 million tourists visited the region in 2024, a rise from 2.71 million visitors in 2023 and 2.67 million in 2022. The massive influx prompted many locals to invest in the sector, setting up family-run guesthouses, luxury hotels, and transport companies in a region with few alternatives. Tourists remained largely unfazed even as Modi’s administration has governed Kashmir with an iron fist in recent years, claiming militancy in the region was in check and a tourism influx was a sign of normalcy returning. The massacre shattered those claims. Experts say that the Modi government’s optimism was largely misplaced and that the rising tourism in the region of which it boasted was a fragile barometer of normalcy. Last year, Abdullah, the region’s chief minister, cautioned against such optimism. Tuman, who is also a sixth-generation tour operator, said he was not too optimistic about an immediate revival as bookings for the summer were almost all canceled. “If all goes well, it will take at least six months for tourism to revive,” he said. Ahmed, the hotels association official, said India and Pakistan need to resolve the dispute for the region’s prosperity. “Tourism needs peace. If (Kashmir) problem is not solved ... maybe after two months, it will be again same thing.” Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

            "description": "By 2027, 16-year-olds in Northern Ireland could be able to vote, if motions are passed.",
            "content": "In two years' time, five students that spoke to BBC News NI at Belfast High School in County Antrim will turn 16, meaning they'll be able to get a job, donate blood or even join the armed forces. By 2027, they might also be counted among the first 16-year-olds in Northern Ireland who could be able to vote. It's a prospect that excites some of them, like 14-year-old Bea, who said if young people are contributing to society they should get a say on who makes the rules. \"It would be amazing, 16-year-olds should have a say, especially if they are getting jobs.\" There's already been a long-running grassroots campaign to change the law in Northern Ireland, but things ramped up a gear when Labour made a promise in last year's election manifesto to reduce the voting age from 18 to 16. The Northern Ireland Assembly has twice supported a motion calling for the change - first in 2012 and then again last year, but without the support of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). Without full-party agreement at Stormont it remains in the hands of the Labour government at Westminster, which is already playing catch-up with governments in Scotland and Wales, where 16-year-olds can already vote. In April, Secretary of State Hilary Benn said the government was \"absolutely committed\" to changing the law in Northern Ireland, but couldn't give a timeframe. \"It's just about getting legislative time in parliament - politics is about the future and if you can be a company director at the age of 16 I think you should be able to vote,\" he said. That sentiment goes down well with fellow pupil, Freya. She said: \"It does get annoying when governments can make laws and we don't have any say, if the government changes the minimum wage I don't want to be trying to get a job at 16 and being paid little. \"They think it's okay because we're younger but it makes you feel like you're in a minority.\" Alliance is among the parties at Stormont who want the voting age to be lowered. Assembly member Sian Mulholland said those against the move should realise that \"the sky didn't fall in when they changed the law in Scotland\". \"It showed that young people were more likely to go on and vote in subsequent elections, it started and fostered a lifelong journey.\" But the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP)'s Deborah Erskine said there could be \"unintended consequences\" if the law is changed. \"I was always very politically in tune but my friends weren't when I was 16. Did I want to vote at 16? Probably not actually. \"This is not just about party political gain, we need to take a lot into consideration including schools in terms of the political nature and how that could manifest itself in debates.\" Rory can understand the arguments against change, adding: \"16-year-olds don't need any more pressure, they already have a lot going on. \"If pressure can be minimised a lot of us probably would want to vote even if we don't know much about politics.\" Ethan feels lowering the voting age would mean schools could do more to engage with students about the basics of politics. \"Schools set us up for life in a lot of aspects but the one it doesn't really is politics, they don't teach us that much about what voting is, I think this would encourage us as well to find out a bit more on our own.\" Sai would like to see schools bringing in politicians more regularly to explain their policies, as he thinks sometimes parties take younger people for granted. \"Telling us what they're trying to achieve and what they stand for would make a big difference to us when we might be voting, whether that's at 16 or 18 or later.\" Northern Ireland's Chief Electoral Officer David Marshall said it could be a number of years before any changes take effect. \"This would be the biggest change in voter registration age laws since franchise was changed in 1969 from 21 to 18; there are substantial changes required,\" he said. He added that his office \"stands ready\" to support the government if it goes ahead to implement the policy. As for whether the students at Belfast High School stand ready to vote when they turn 16, their message to the politicians is: \"Get it done.\"",

            "content": "SRINAGAR, India (AP) — There are hardly any tourists in the scenic Himalayan region of Kashmir . Most of the hotels and ornate pinewood houseboats are empty. Resorts in the snowclad mountains have fallen silent. Hundreds of cabs are parked and idle. It’s the fallout of last month’s gun massacre that left 26 people, mostly Hindu tourists, dead in Indian-controlled Kashmir followed by tit-for-tat military strikes by India and Pakistan, bringing the nuclear-armed rivals to the brink of their third war over the region. “There might be some tourist arrivals, but it counts almost negligible. It is almost a zero footfall right now,” said Yaseen Tuman, who operates multiple houseboats in the region’s main city of Srinagar. “There is a haunting silence now.” Tens of thousands of panicked tourists left Kashmir within days after the rare killings of tourists on April 22 at a picture-perfect meadow in southern resort town of Pahalgam. Following the attack, authorities temporarily closed dozens of tourist resorts in the region, adding to fear and causing occupancy rates to plummet. freestar.queue.push(function () { window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0; let customChannel = '_dynamic_' + fsAdCount; let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\") let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount]; let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2); thisAd.id = randId; let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\"; freestar.newAdSlots({ placementName: thisPlacement, slotId: randId }, customChannel); }); Graphic images, repeatedly circulated through TV channels and social media, deepened panic and anger.

As the two countries fired missiles and drones at each other, the region witnessed mass cancellations of tourist bookings. New Delhi and Islamabad reached a U.S.-mediated ceasefire on May 10 but hardly any new bookings have come in, tour operators said. Sheikh Bashir Ahmed, vice president of the Kashmir Hotel and Restaurant Association, said at least 12,000 rooms in the region’s hundreds of hotels and guesthouses were previously booked until June. Almost all bookings have been cancelled, and tens of thousands of people associated with hotels are without jobs, he said. freestar.queue.push(function () { window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0; let customChannel = '_dynamic_' + fsAdCount; let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\") let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount]; let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2); thisAd.id = randId; let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\"; freestar.newAdSlots({ placementName: thisPlacement, slotId: randId }, customChannel); }); “It’s a huge loss.” Ahmed said. The decline has had a ripple effect on the local economy. Handicrafts, food stalls and taxi operators have lost most of their business. Idyllic destinations, like the resort towns of Gulmarg and Pahalgam, once a magnet for travelers, are eerily silent. Lines of colorful hand-carved boats, known as shikaras, lie deserted, mostly anchored still on Srinagar’s normally bustling Dal Lake. Tens of thousands of daily wage workers have hardly any work. “There used to be long lines of tourists waiting for boat rides. There are none now,” said boatman Fayaz Ahmed. Taxi driver Mohammed Irfan would take tourists for long drives to hill stations and show them grand Mughal-era gardens. “Even a half day of break was a luxury, and we would pray for it. Now, my taxi lies standstill for almost two weeks,” he said. In recent years, the tourism sector grew substantially, making up about 7% of the region’s economy, according to official figures. Omar Abdullah , Kashmir’s top elected official, said before the attack on tourists that the government was aiming to increase tourism’s share of the economy to at least 15% in the next four to five years. freestar.queue.push(function () { window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0; let customChannel = '_dynamic_' + fsAdCount; let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\") let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount]; let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2); thisAd.id = randId; let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\"; freestar.newAdSlots({ placementName: thisPlacement, slotId: randId }, customChannel); }); Indian-controlled Kashmir was a top destination for visitors until the armed rebellion against Indian rule began in 1989. Warfare laid waste to the stunningly beautiful region, which is partly controlled by Pakistan and claimed by both countries in its entirety. As the conflict ground on, the tourism sector slowly revived but occasional military skirmishes between India and Pakistan kept visitors at bay. But India vigorously pushed tourism after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government scrapped the disputed region’s semi-autonomy in 2019. Tensions have simmered, but the region has also drawn millions of visitors amid a strange calm enforced by an intensified security crackdown. According to official data, close to 3 million tourists visited the region in 2024, a rise from 2.71 million visitors in 2023 and 2.67 million in 2022. The massive influx prompted many locals to invest in the sector, setting up family-run guesthouses, luxury hotels, and transport companies in a region with few alternatives. freestar.queue.push(function () { window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0; let customChannel = '_dynamic_' + fsAdCount; let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\") let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount]; let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2); thisAd.id = randId; let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\"; freestar.newAdSlots({ placementName: thisPlacement, slotId: randId }, customChannel); }); Tourists remained largely unfazed even as Modi’s administration has governed Kashmir with an iron fist in recent years, claiming militancy in the region was in check and a tourism influx was a sign of normalcy returning. The massacre shattered those claims. Experts say that the Modi government’s optimism was largely misplaced and that the rising tourism in the region of which it boasted was a fragile barometer of normalcy. Last year, Abdullah, the region’s chief minister, cautioned against such optimism. Tuman, who is also a sixth-generation tour operator, said he was not too optimistic about an immediate revival as bookings for the summer were almost all canceled. “If all goes well, it will take at least six months for tourism to revive,” he said. Ahmed, the hotels association official, said India and Pakistan need to resolve the dispute for the region’s prosperity. “Tourism needs peace. If (Kashmir) problem is not solved ... maybe after two months, it will be again same thing.”",

READ: US loses last triple-A credit rating as Moody’s cuts over government debt The news brought an end to a healthy run-up in recent weeks that was stoked by the China-US tariff detente and signs of progress between the United States and other countries on trade. Bond yields spiked across the board as investors demanded more interest for holding government debt, signaling their fears about the world’s biggest economy — 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since late 2023. The selling came after the auction of 20-year bonds attracted tepid interest, and brought back memories of the sell-off that followed US President Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff blitz last month, which was followed by the White House taking a less aggressive approach. All three main indexes on Wall Street ended sharply lower. READ: US stocks tumble as bond yields spike amid deficit worries A tax bill pushed by Trump that is currently going through Congress pairs an extension of the tax cuts from Trump’s first presidential term with steep savings in government spending to pay for them. But many market watchers do not expect the spending cuts in the package to be sufficient to offset the tax cuts, lifting the deficit. “The proposed tax cuts are raising concerns from economists about the US’s fiscal position and there are signs of anxiety in the bond markets about the country’s debt burden,” said National Australia Bank’s Tapas Strickland. READ: Trump mega-bill clears hurdle after rebels drop opposition Trump’s first-term Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, warned that “the budget deficit is a larger concern to me than the trade deficit” and called for more spending cuts. Asian equities also sank, with Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, Seoul, Taipei, Wellington and Manila all in the red. The dollar also held losses on growing concerns about the US economy, while the uncertainty helped revive demand for safe-haven gold, which was sitting around $3,340 an ounce. And there are now fears that stocks could be in for another rough ride. “These higher long-end yields make it a whole lot harder to justify today’s equity valuations,” said Stephen Innes at SPI Asset Management. “Tech and growth names — already stretched — are staring down the barrel of a tangible equity to rates market repricing, and this could cap the rally fuel that’s been driving risk assets since the April tariff detente.” Still, bitcoin broke a fresh record of $110,707 as US lawmakers showed greater bipartisan support for a cryptocurrency bill on the regulation of so-called stablecoins, digital coins whose value is tied to the dollar. This has sparked fresh hopes for regulatory clarity in the sector, including for bitcoin, which is not directly linked to the dollar. Oil prices extended losses after data from the US Energy Information Administration showed the country’s stockpiles had risen last week. The news helped reverse a rally in the commodity on Wednesday that was sparked by a CNN report that Israel was planning a strike on Iranian nuclear sites.

            "description": "Lord Frost has not ruled out running for Reform UK at a future general election.",
            "content": "Lord Frost has not ruled out running for Reform UK at a future general election. The former chief Brexit negotiator said he was “not emotionally committed to the Conservatives” and that he struggled to see what the party’s “USP” (unique selling point) was. Speaking to The Telegraph’s Planet Normal podcast , the Tory peer was asked whether he would rule out standing for Reform UK in the future. “ I’m waiting. What I want is a last chance really for a party on the Right that can deliver meaningful Right-wing, principled policies,” he said. “I’m not emotionally committed to the Conservatives in the way that others are. I want the party that is going to do the job and get the job done, and let’s see how that plays out.” The former Cabinet minister said the Tories “still haven’t really clocked what the problem is” with the party and its sinking popularity following the general election wipe-out last year. It comes after the Conservatives sank to their lowest ever poll rating recorded by YouGov, one of Britain’s most reputable pollsters. The survey, carried out on May 18 and 19, found the Tories were now in fourth place and polling at just 16 per cent. The party lost every council it was defending at this month’s local elections as Nigel Farage’s Reform continued to surge. Lord Frost told the podcast: “I think up until maybe these local [elections] and the latest round of polling, I think the dominant view was ‘we just have got to wait, it’ll come right, people will turn back to us, Labour are terrible, Reform will blow up, we don’t really have to do anything, it’ll all be OK’. “I think the local elections and then these latest polls that put us fourth are beginning to spook people a bit – and rightly so, in my view.” Boris ally avoided candidacy Lord Frost, a Boris Johnson ally , decided not to run to become a Conservative MP at last year’s general election. He had angered Downing Street at the beginning of last year when he was involved in commissioning an opinion poll that laid bare the likely impact of the Tories’ unpopularity. The following month, he was understood to have been labelled as “deferred” on the Conservative Party’s approved candidates list, which meant he could not seek to run as an MP at that cycle and would have to wait for another time. But Rishi Sunak , the then-prime minister, said he was free to seek a seat – an offer he did not take up. Lord Frost told the podcast: “The idea that Reform is a wasted vote is no longer true, to the same extent, probably won’t be true at all soon. I must say, I struggle sometimes to see what you get when you vote Conservative. What’s the USP? “I’m not a lifer Conservative. I only came into it... because I want to get Brexit done . For me, the political parties on the Right are vehicles for getting the right policies in place, and as soon as they fail to get the right policies in place – well, they become a bit pointless.” Planet Normal, a weekly Telegraph podcast featuring news and views from beyond the bubble.

            "content": "The Guardian newspaper reports Sir Keir Starmer rowed back on the £300 cut because it's \"all people wanted to talk about\". The real reason the Labour Party government u-turned over the £300 Winter Fuel Payment has emerged. The Guardian newspaper reports Sir Keir Starmer rowed back on the £300 cut because it's \"all people wanted to talk about\". After months of mounting anger from voters and pressure from MPs No 10 accepted a change on Wednesday. “It is all people wanted to talk about on the doorstep,” said one source. “Some were upset about the coming cuts to disability benefits, some were exercised by immigration. But everyone was angry about winter fuel payments.” READ MORE UK tourists in Spain warned to stop booking 'seven, 10 or 14 day stays' “The decision was taken by the Treasury,” said one former government aide. “By the time Downing Street saw it, it had already been factored into the forecasts and it was too late to change it.” “It comes up on the doorstep all the time. Winter fuel will lose us the next election, it was a terrible mistake. But it’s probably too late for a U-turn now,” one cabinet minister lamented. A group of MPs from “red wall” constituencies issued a joint statement. “Responding to the issues raised by our constituents, including on winter fuel, isn’t weak – it takes us to a position of strength,” it said. Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch and Labour backbenchers are among those to ask how quickly the Government can implement the turnaround. Badenoch has written to the Prime Minister demanding to know whether the reversal would “come into effect in time for payments to be made for this winter”, given a budget could be “six months away”. She warned: “Pensioners are typically living on fixed incomes. They need to be able to plan ahead. We have heard from many who have suffered through the past winter as a result of your Government’s callous decision to remove their winter fuel payments. \"Some have had to choose between heating and eating.” Labour Party MP Rachael Maskell said: “It seems that the sequencing of this would preclude people this coming winter, unless they did something else to enable people to get it. “Now that’s an assumption that it is going to be predicated on a pension credit. We just don’t know. But it could mean that people would then go cold for a further winter.”",

            "description": "Pope Leo’s fluency in English, Spanish and Italian will help him govern the global church — and the Vatican.",
            "content": "In 2016, I was working with a team in the Vatican to put Pope Francis on Instagram. I made the case that simplicity was key and that we should therefore provide captions in just three languages: Italian, English and Spanish. I lost the argument, and @franciscus debuted in nine languages. But English, Spanish and Italian led the list. With the election of Pope Leo — someone who not only speaks those three languages fluently but knows well the cultures behind them — I feel like I’ve won. They’re the three most important languages in the Roman Catholic Church today. Because language reflects culture, Leo’s linguistic gifts could help him make a mark on the governance of the church both globally and in the Vatican. Leo was born in the middle of America and attended school on the South Side of Chicago, but his two decades as a missionary and bishop in Peru and a church official in Rome allowed him to embrace both Italian and Hispanic cultures as well. You can view the new pope as either not very American, or the very best that America has to offer — someone who made a sacrifice as a missionary to serve in a country much poorer than his own, embracing the culture and loving his new neighbors. Leo is the first native English speaker to ascend the throne of Peter in nearly 900 years, after Adrian IV in the 12th century. Unlike during the Middle Ages, he does it at a time when Anglophone culture dominates global communications, finance, technology and the arts. English is the new Latin, the language of the Empire of the Internet. Italian to my ears is the most beautiful of the new pope’s languages, and knowing it helps so much in understanding — and loving — Italy. But it can also be confusing. Leave it to Italian politicians to give us the concept of “convergenze parallele,” or “parallel convergences,” to describe how opposing political parties can accommodate each other’s position. Though only a tiny percentage of Catholics speak Italian, it’s the language of the Vatican and necessary for the pontiff to communicate with his collaborators. Italian is also essential in understanding how things work (and often don’t) in the Roman Curia, or Vatican bureaucracy. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

            "description": "The director understood people will remember how you left with grace just as much as they remember how you performed at your peak",
            "content": "This was an obvious occupational hazard when electing Joe Biden to the presidency at age 80 – even before his infirmity became so apparent, and long before his recent cancer diagnosis. Donald Trump will be 82 when his term ends. This will make him the oldest president in the US’s history. In a political system that centralises so much power on the whims of one man, you have to think about these things: the entire fortune of a nation – and with it, the direction of the world – can change with a nasty fall or late-stage diagnosis. With Biden, it was not his physical body that precluded him from running for the presidency again, but his mental acuity (or lack of). Had the Biden camp successfully managed their campaign of concealment and obfuscation when it came to his cognitive decline, and Biden himself had somehow managed to sneak the presidency from Trump in spite of all the polling telling him it was unlikely, however, he may well have died in office anyway. Friendly or not to Biden’s school of politics, a leader dying in office is an unmooring event for a country and everyone in it. And it is – where possible – probably best avoided. That comes with the cold and some-might-say ageist argument that there is a time when people need to acknowledge they are no longer able to perform at their best. Tennis players face a similar calculation. And Andy Murray made the same mistake: refusing to depart from the game despite multiple surgeries, serious pain and a slew of losses to players he once would have beaten. A new biography of Rafael Nadal similarly traces his decline, as his injuries eventually eclipsed his determination to win. Biden’s will for power, self-belief and commitment to shoring up his legacy ultimately had to succumb to the material facts of his age. His defiance in the face of the inevitable will shape his reputation, long after he is dead. Meanwhile, Quentin Tarantino – a long term fan of boxing and related films – determined when the human prime was from observing the sport. He saw how these men lost when they got older, how they just didn’t have it any more. For most, this comes in their 30s. The director then resolved only to make ten films: he would be too old by the 11th, he wants a tight body of work and he doesn’t want a bad film to spoil the reception of his entire career. He understands – in a way that Murray and Biden didn’t – that people will remember how you left with grace just as much as they remember how you performed at your peak. The difference with Biden, however, is that the stakes were much higher. This was not a case of a lost Open or a bad film, a singular reputation sadly tarnished but no wider effects. As the world reckons with Trump and entire continents are restructuring their political alignments, the long shadow of Biden is impossible to ignore. The Economist recently made a convincing argument about Nigel Farage . He has had three close encounters with death: a car crash, a cancer diagnosis shortly afterwards and an aeroplane crash 25 years after both. He might be on the brink of rerouting British politics forever, as the Conservative Party spirals into total irrelevance and Reform is cannibalising its corpse. The problem with Reform, though – the precarity baked into the DNA of the party – is that Farage himself is primarily responsible for the movement’s success. He is, simply put, extremely popular. If he goes, the movement goes with him – or so The Economist contends. [ Joe Biden’s reputation was ruined in the morning, revived in the afternoon. It won’t last Opens in new window ] The Great Men of History thesis is unfashionable but not a totally useless tool of analysis. Just look at Farage and then look at Biden – his personal decision to defy infirmity led us to this treacherous political moment. Pedants will turn around and bark at you about “structures” and “trends” and “systems” and how all of those forge societies’ direction of travel. Sure. But so do individuals, per se. If Ruth Bader Ginsberg had resigned from the Supreme Court at the right time, women across the United States would be facing a rather different lot. The problem with Great Men of History is that, like all men in history, they die. And with them, the political or cultural universe they created. It’s a burden that shouldn’t be worn lightly and should never be sublimated at the altar of self-belief or personal interest in power. Biden was not a great president but it is hard to argue that he was a bad man. His determination not to withdraw was a serious miscalculation. But Great Men are often defined by those.",

            "content": "Presented by Hydrogen EuropeBy KARL MATHIESENwith ZOYA SHEFTALOVICHPRESENTED BY Send tips here | Tweet @NicholasVinocur @swheaton | Listen to Playbook and view in your browserGRIM NEWS TO WAKE UP TO: Two Israeli Embassy staffers in Washington were shot dead in the early hours of this morning, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said in a social media post. A spokesperson for the Israeli Embassy said the people were shot “at close range while attending a Jewish event” at the Capital Jewish Museum, CNN reports.MEANWHILE, IN THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Accusations of physical and verbal aggression flew between Swedish EPP lawmaker Alice Teodorescu and an unnamed staffer from Swedish left-wing party Vänsterpartiet. The altercation appears to have been related to a debate about Gaza held Wednesday.Fingers pointed: Teodorescu’s party says the staffer was at fault; Vänsterpartiet claims it was the MEP who was the aggressor. Both parties have said they’ve filed complaints to the Parliament, and the police have also reportedly been notified.G’DAY. I’m Karl Mathiesen and it’s Thursday morning. Sarah Wheaton will see out the week.DRIVING THE DAY: SOCIALISTS IN THE WILDERNESS LOOKING FOR ANSWERS: The center left were largely bystanders on Sunday’s super day of European democracy. Or worse. In Portugal, the recently mighty Socialist Party (PS) now has the same number of seats as far-right Chega. In Brussels and beyond, an uncomfortable post-mortem is raising more questions than answers. Left out: In presidential elections in Romania and Poland, the candidates belonging to the Party of European Socialists (PES) family (supposedly Europe’s second-mightiest political force) didn’t make the top two runoff. In Portugal, voters hammered the hapless PS, which lost votes in almost every region in the country for the second election in a row.Soul searching: “The recent results are not encouraging,” said Victor Negrescu, a vice president of the Socialists and Democrats (S&D) grouping that the PS is a member of in the European Parliament. Negrescu is an MEP from Romania, where his party leader resigned this month after its presidential candidate crashed out in third. “It is clear that we have to reconnect with people’s daily struggles and expectations: rising inequality, the cost of living, insecurity,” Negrescu said.Costa living crisis: Things haven’t exactly gone well for the PS since former leader António Costa swapped Lisbon for the airy trappings of the European Council. But his failure to groom a successor and tackle real economic pain, while also stoking uncontrolled tourism amid a spiraling housing crisis, laid the rails for this week’s defeat, my colleague Aitor Hernández-Morales said in a voice note from the Portuguese capital.Then ... As Chega rose in the polls since 2019, Costa’s government “lacked clear policy direction and largely operated in a caretaker mode,” and “his resignation was never clearly explained to the electorate,” said Nuno Garoupa, a professor at George Mason University and a renowned Portugal watcher. Blame game 1: “The PS finds itself confronted with Costa’s legacy,” the opinion pages of Expresso howled.NOT PANICKING ... is PES Secretary-General Giacomo Filibeck. The crisis of social democrats is a perennial cycle “that we see always,” and then overcome. “We have a challenging situation to face,” he admits, “but we are conscious about it and ready to take measures for it.”TBD: But what exactly the center left will do to “reconnect” is a matter for its congress in the fall. Woke and chew gum: Filibeck pushed back against criticisms that Europe’s center left had become too embroiled in culture war issues and lost sight of voters’ economic concerns. “One thing doesn’t exclude the other. To recognize, acknowledge and respect civil rights everywhere in Europe does not imply that our social rights are becoming of less importance ... I believe we will continue to fight for both.”And don’t forget: “It’s not precisely fully correct or true that we lose everything, everywhere,” he said. “We won in Lithuania a couple of months ago.” (It was October, to be precise.)Blame game 2: Filibeck reckons it’s the EPP that bears the responsibility for the blooming far-right vote in many European elections because in places like Sweden, Spain, Italy, Finland and the Netherlands “traditional center-right parties have decided to open up their doors to creating coalition with radical nationalist right-wing parties, breaking the firewall.”We are the only ones who can beat the far right 1: “We really fear that the whole European project may be at stake here. And we feel that if it’s not us defending it, it’s gonna be hard for the project itself to survive,” said Filibeck.IT’S ON EVERYONE’S MIND: POLITICO today carries a major interview with the EPP’s president, Manfred Weber, warning against this exact thing. European conservatives are buoyed by their recent electoral successes. But Weber says they should avoid the trap of their predecessors in the Weimar Republic, who rolled over for the Nazis.Hitler’s handmaidens: “Having also my German history in mind with Weimar and the Nazi regime, then the real historic mistake was to give right-extreme politicians executive power, and that is for us the red line,” Weber tells Max Griera.That’s a jab at ... several national branches of the EPP which, as Filibeck points out, are already playing with fire. We are the only ones who can beat the far right 2: Weber’s solution, unsurprisingly, is for everyone else in the center to do more or less what the EPP says. After the European election in 2024 delivered a rightward shift, other parties should support more conservative policies, he says: “There is no left-liberal majority anymore in this house and that must also be translated in politics.”Just don’t mention ... that the EPP itself gained exactly one seat in last year’s election.FRANCE GOES HEAVY METAL DON’T STOP NOW: Just days after Emmanuel Macron teamed up with Germany to light the cremation fires under Europe’s corporate due diligence law, the French president’s lieutenant in Brussels has issued a call for an even greater conflagration. Slash and burn: In an exclusive chat with Playbook’s Nicholas Vinocur, France’s European Affairs Minister Benjamin Haddad said red-tape cutting should be extended to defense and the EU should stop working on the bloc’s 2040 climate target. “This is not the time to add complexity, but to see how we can make sure our companies are competitive on the international stage,” he said. “We have a window to act and we need to take it.”Transport pun enthusiast klaxon: “The omnibus needs to become a TGV,” Haddad quipped.Someone missed the memo: When we asked the environment ministry about this recently, a spokesperson told us: “France supports an ambitious 2040 target, and this is what we expect from the European Commission.”ONE MORE REASON THE FRENCH ARE REVOLTING ... against green regulation is the extraordinary advance of the yellow hats farmers movement — which is increasingly turning the French countryside on to the far right, and the protectionist trade politics of American President Donald Trump. Read it now: Marion Solletty goes on maneuvers with “the army of the serfs.”VDL’S GAZA PROBLEM THE INFERNO WIDENS: After EU member countries set in motion a formal review of EU-Israel trade relations over the spiraling horror in Gaza, the pressure is increasing for the Commission — and its leader — to make some room for criticism alongside their staunch support of the Israeli government.No let up: Last night in a rare press conference, Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to continue the war until the entire Gaza Strip was under military control, the BBC said.No relief: Netanyahu said a new aid delivery system for Gaza, involving a “sterile zone” cleared of Hamas fighters, would be working within days, AP reported. The U.N. said none of the aid that has entered Gaza in recent days had actually reached Palestinians.S&D gets personal: European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, one of Israel’s most unwavering supporters in Europe since the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack, came under direct fire from S&D leader Iratxe García during a debate on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza in Parliament on Wednesday. “How can the president of the European Commission remain silent in the face of a project of extermination and ethnic cleansing that is broadcast live, every day, from Gaza?” said García.We’ve been here before: “Our response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine was forceful, swift and exemplary. And now, what is the value of international legality if it is only applied when it is convenient? Do we want the European Union to go down in history for repeating the mistakes of the international community in Rwanda and Srebrenica?” asked the S&D president.This sounds like just the job for ... the European commissioner for intergenerational fairness, youth, culture and sport: Eyebrows were raised in the Parliament by the choice to send Maltese Commissioner Glenn Micallef to the debate. An S&D official said they were “concerned and sadly surprised” that neither von der Leyen nor EU foreign affairs chief Kaja Kallas were present. The Left called the decision to send the Commission’s “most junior” member a “clear insult to the European Parliament and to the gravity of the situation.”Other stuff on: A spokesperson for the Commission said Kallas was unable to attend as she was at a summit with the African Union.Diplomacy, Israel-style: Also on Wednesday, Kallas condemned the Israeli military for firing shots to warn a diplomatic delegation that included European representatives they were traveling in a restricted area. The Israeli military said it “regrets the inconvenience caused.”RIGHT-WINGERS IN THE WILD WHAT’S THE WAY TO A WOMAN’S HEART? Above, we took you inside the left-wing soul-searching going on in Brussels and beyond. For some insight into what the right-wingers are worried about, Playbook reporter Šejla Ahmatović dropped in on an event on women and conservatism on Wednesday evening, hosted by Hungarian state-funded right-wing think tank MCC Brussels.Inside the Hotel Martin’s Brussels, just a stone’s throw from the European Commission’s Berlaymont building, four female speakers — including Patriots for Europe MEP Barbara Bonte — offered their take on why women are increasingly voting for leftist parties (and how to reverse the trend). Another agenda item: how to encourage conservative women to pursue careers.This oughta do it: Bonte argued that child-rearing should be recognized as a “civic contribution” and subsidized by the state. She also called for womanhood and motherhood to be taught in schools, though by whom, the Belgian politician didn’t say. French far-right activist Alice Cordier said “conservative parties are not addressing women’s concerns,” and called for what she described as right-wing feminism.That Insta life: Polish journalist Aleksandra Rybińska claimed that for today’s women, “life is a collection of experiences, an Instagram life.” As young women moved to cities to build careers, she said, “young men are frustrated because they can’t find a wife.” The men sitting next to your reporter and several others in the audience nodded in agreement.Eggs and opposition: The room was full, the microphones worked, but the speeches had competition from outside. Around 80 anti-fascist demonstrators gathered at the hotel entrance, their chants clearly audible throughout the event. The protest was eventually dispersed — but not before the demonstrators hurled dozens of eggs at the building and the police guarding it.IN OTHER NEWS SANCTIONS FOREVER: Ukraine plans to pitch the EU next week on a new sanctions round that would include seizing Russian assets and bringing in sanctions for some buyers of Russian oil, Reuters reports.From Trump’s lips to Europe’s ear: U.S. President Donald Trump told European leaders during their phone call on Monday that Vladimir Putin isn’t ready to end Russia’s war on Ukraine because he thinks he’s winning, the Wall Street Journal reports, citing three people familiar with the conversation.LOOK WHO POPPED UP IN ROMANIA: European Parliament President Roberta Metsola continued her habit of being first in, best dressed, meeting Romania’s President-elect/EU Great Hope Nicușor Dan last night. She wrote on social media: “Together in Bucharest. Together for Europe. Together for Romania.” Ahead of the trip, Metsola said in a statement that she looked forward to traveling to Romania “at such an important moment for the country.” The official reason for the visit is for Metsola to collect the Timișoara Award for European Values, a €30,000 prize doled out to international figures who promote Europe’s core values. (Though Metsola won’t be pocketing the cash, having asked for it to be added to next year’s award.)IN TRUMP’S CLEAN ENERGY WAR, EUROPE AND CHINA COULD WIN: The U.S. president simply does not care that walking away from clean energy could present America’s competitors with a multibillion-dollar opportunity. That’s opening up a fundamental divide within Trump’s Republican Party over how to confront China.

Ellen O’Regan reports EU countries and lawmakers couldn’t agree on the thorny topics of deadlines and judicial remedies.NOR ON BIG PHARMA: Senior diplomats from EU countries also failed to reach an agreement on the capitals’ position on an overhaul of Europe’s pharmaceutical legislation.8 EYES: Belgium, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Sweden and the Netherlands have joined forces to share intelligence, strengthen security and resilience as the bloc faces a growing number of military, hybrid, terrorist and criminal threats as well as foreign interference and manipulation, according a statement seen by our defense team and reporter Max Griera.LATEST TRUMP APPEAL: The FT reports this morning that Brussels is considering extending tariff-free access for U.S. lobsters in its bid to see off Trump’s tariffs.ICYMI — HUAWEI NAMES: Belgian authorities asked the European Parliament to lift the immunity of center-right Italian MEPs Fulvio Martusciello and Giusi Princi in relation to an investigation into a cash-for influence scandal connected to Chinese firm Huawei, Max Griera reports. That follows requests for Maltese Socialist Daniel Attard, Bulgarian liberal Nikola Minchev, and the EPP’s Salvatore De Meo, all of whom went public earlier this week to defend their innocence and vowed to collaborate with the Belgian authorities. AGENDA — Competitiveness Council (Internal market and industry). Agenda.— G7 finance ministers and central bank governors’ meeting in Banff, Canada; Economy Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis participates.— NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte visits Norway; meets Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide and Defense Minister Tore Sandvik.— European Parliament mini plenary concludes in Brussels.

Hier ist Rasmus Buchsteiner mit Ihrem Playbook. Wenn Sie das hier lesen, ist Friedrich Merz mal wieder auf und davon. Augen geradeaus: Vergangenes Jahr war er im Cockpit eines Eurofighters dabei und donnerte mit Überschallgeschwindigkeit über die Ostsee. Heute steigt Merz wieder in ein Flugzeug — aber mit deutlich weniger Speed. Unsere Top-Themen heute: Der Kanzler und sein Truppenbesuch in Litauen, eine Milliarden-Operation zur Stabilisierung unserer Sozialkassen, der Auszug der Abgeordneten aus dem Bundestags-Modulbau und die Antwort auf die Frage, was es mit der Formel „3+3+3+2“ auf sich hat. Hörtipp: Gordon Repinski spricht im Playbook Podcast mit Siemtje Möller über die Kanzlerreise nach Litauen. Und im Update geht es um den Start von Innenminister Alexander Dobrindt.**(Anzeige) Eine Nachricht von Fuchs & Cie.: Die Zeit der Gratulationsschreiben ist vorbei. Die neue Legislaturperiode hat begonnen. Die Billion wird ausgeben. Jetzt geht es um konkrete Inhalte. Wir wissen, was als nächstes kommt. Dabei gibt es kein „zu früh“. Nur ein „zu spät“. Strategische Beratung, operative Unterstützung und tragfähiges Netzwerk unter www.fuchs-cie.com. **SEITE EINSAUF SCHOLZ’ SPUREN: In seiner ersten Regierungserklärung gab es diesen einen Moment, in dem Friedrich Merz seinem Vorgänger Respekt zollte. Eine Art Verneigung war es, hier noch einmal zu sehen (ab Minute 2:46). Hallo Ostflanke: Wenn man es so sehen will, tritt Merz heute offiziell das Erbe des Zeitenwende-Kanzlers Scholz an. Warum? Heute früh geht es nach Litauen, an die Nato-Ostflanke also. Es ist der erste Besuch des neuen Regierungschefs bei der Truppe, die möglichst rasch die stärkste konventionelle Armee des Kontinents werden soll, wenn es nach ihm geht. Das Signal von Vilnius: Merz will mehr Zeitenwende wagen. Und dafür braucht er die richtigen Bilder, die richtigen Worte. Was eignet sich also besser als der feierliche Appell, bei dem die Panzerbrigade 45 offiziell in Dienst gestellt wird? Permanent: Die Stationierung der Litauen-Brigade — bis 2027 auf rund 4800 Soldaten und 200 zivile Kräfte — geht auf einen Vorstoß von Boris Pistorius zurück, der mit Merz heute vor Ort ist. Das Ganze war zuletzt begleitet worden von mühsamen Debatten um Planung und den Aufbau der Infrastruktur. Respekt: „Die Entscheidung Deutschlands, eine Brigade dauerhaft nach Litauen zu entsenden, ist ein historischer Schritt“, sagt Litauens Verteidigungsministerin Dovilė Šakalienė zu Johanna Sahlberg. Deutschland sei in Litauen, um die gesamte Nato zu verteidigen: „Der Frieden muss mit Einigkeit und Entschlossenheit verteidigt werden.“We promise: „In der Zwischenzeit ist Litauen bereit, die gesamte Infrastruktur rechtzeitig bereitzustellen und die notwendige Unterstützung des Gastgeberlandes zu leisten“, so Šakalienė, die Merz heute trifft.Warm welcome: Außenminister Kęstutis Budrys bezeichnete Merz’ Besuch als „einen wichtigen Meilenstein in unseren bilateralen Beziehungen“.Aufstockung: 400 deutsche Soldaten sind bisher bei der Brigade stationiert, bis Ende des Jahres sollen es 500 werden. 2026 sollen es mehr als 2000 sein. Die Aufstockung laufe planmäßig nach der Road Map, hört Rixa Fürsen aus dem Verteidigungsministerium. Anspruch > Wirklichkeit: Merz spricht heute beim Appell auf dem Kathedralenplatz von Vilnius. Und zwar in zivil, nicht in Flecktarn, wie Hans von der Burchard hört. Es dürfte deutlich werden, dass für die Bundeswehr nun ganz offiziell gilt: Whatever it takes.Uneingeschränkte Solidarität: Es gehe jetzt um „das klare Signal an Russland, dass wir verteidigungsbereit sind“, so SPD-Fraktionsvize Siemtje Möller im Playbook Podcast. Wir machen schon viel: Wenige Wochen vor dem so wichtigen Nato-Gipfel in Den Haag will Merz Deutschland als Bündnispartner so untadelig wie nur möglich wirken lassen. Der neue No-limits-Schulden-Passus für die Verteidigung steht ja auch schon im Grundgesetz. Moment mal: Der Kanzler weiß aber auch, dass die Ausstattung der Bundeswehr (noch) dürftig ist, dass Personal fehlt und die Truppenstärke weit von dem entfernt ist, was für erforderlich gehalten wird.Back to the 70s. Merz — als junger Mann T2 gemustert, Wehrdienst 1975/76 — kann sich noch gut an seine Zeit beim Bund erinnern, zum Beispiel an „das scharfe Nachtschießen mit der großen Panzerartillerie-Haubitze“.Possibly: Mag sein, dass er bald noch mehr Zeitenwende wagen muss. Dann, wenn das Verteidigungsministerium seinen Gesetzentwurf zum neuen freiwilligen Wehrdienst fertig hat — und sich die Frage stellt, ob das wirklich ausreicht.KANZLERMAPPEMAL ETWAS INNENPOLITIK: Zurück aus dem Baltikum geht es für Merz ins Kanzleramt. Um 18:15 Uhr ist er dort mit Anke Rehlinger verabredet. Die saarländische Ministerpräsidentin bringt ihr komplettes Kabinett mit, das gerade in Berlin in Klausur ist. Die Themen: Strukturwandel, Industriepolitik, Energieversorgung und Grüner Stahl. Da war doch was?! Stimmt.Nice-to-know I: Merz ist auch ein bisschen Saarländer. Mit seiner Frau Charlotte, die aus dem Saarland stammt, lebte er einige Jahre in Saarbrücken, arbeitete dort als Richter am Amtsgericht. Aber das nur nebenbei. Nice-to-know II: Der saarländische Finanzminister Jakob von Weizsäcker war es, der während der Sondierungen die Blaupause für Schuldenbremsenreform und Sondervermögen auf den Tisch packte und Merz aus der Klemme half. Heute kommt es zum Wiedersehen.AUßENKANZLER AUFGEPASST: Die Lage in Nahost wird heute Sorgenthema bleiben. Auf seiner Litauen-Reise sollte sich Merz auch auf mögliche kritische Journalisten-Fragen zum jüngsten Vorfall im Westjordanland vorbereiten, wo israelische Truppen auf westliche Diplomaten — darunter auch ein Deutscher — das Feuer eröffneten. „Diesen unprovozierten Beschuss verurteilt das Auswärtige Amt scharf“, so eine Sprecherin. „Wir können von Glück reden, dass nichts Schlimmeres passiert ist.“ Israels Militär teilte mit, man hätte die Diplomaten zunächst als Bedrohung wahrgenommen und Warnschüsse abgefeuert. UND DANN IST DA NOCH DIE FLUGVERSPÄTUNG NACH WASHINGTON: Eigentlich wollte Merz Ende nächster Woche zu Donald Trump ins Weiße Haus, doch bei der Terminabsprache gibt es weiter Schwierigkeiten. Stattdessen wird nun der Donnerstag oder Freitag der ersten Juniwoche wahrscheinlicher, wie Hans erfahren hat.Für Sorge in der Regierung sorgt ein neuer New York Times-Bericht, wonach Trump nach seinem Telefonat mit Putin am Montag gegenüber Merz, Wolodymyr Selenskyj und anderen EU-Chefs sagte, dass er keine neuen Sanktionen gegenüber Putin mehr unterstütze. Über das transatlantische Zerwürfnis in der Frage haben wir am Dienstag berichtet.Auch das noch: Die USA lehnen offenbar die Aufnahme einer „weiteren Unterstützung“ für die Ukraine in einer neuen G7-Finanzminister-Erklärung ab, so zwei an den Verhandlungen beteiligte Beamte gegenüber unserem Brüsseler Kollegen Gregorio Sorgi.EBENFALLS LEICHT VERSPÄTET: Am liebsten hätten Merz und Emmanuel Macron ihr erstes Kabinettstreffen — den sogenannten deutsch-französischen Ministerrat — noch vor der Sommerpause veranstaltet, doch nun läuft es wahrscheinlich auf Ende August hinaus, berichtet Hans.PARTEIENMATHEHEFTE RAUS, denn es wird anspruchsvoll, wenn es um die Struktur des Koalitionsausschusses geht. In einem „3+3+3+2“-Format kommen die Koalitionäre aus CDU, CSU und SPD künftig zusammen, um regelmäßig die größten Themen der Regierungsarbeit zu besprechen. Das erfuhren Gordon Repinski und ich gestern aus Koalitionskreisen. Wer darf dabei sein? Kanzler Merz bringt Jens Spahn und Carsten Linnemann mit in die Runde. Linnemann ist als einziger Generalsekretär dabei. Die CSU kommt mit Markus Söder, Alexander Dobrindt und Landesgruppenchef Alexander Hoffmann an den Tisch.Womanpower: Die SPD hat mit Bärbel Bas die einzige Frau dabei. Sie geht gemeinsam mit Lars Klingbeil und Matthias Miersch an den Start.Can we be your +2? Thorsten Frei und Björn Böhning — Finanzstaatssekretär und Regierungskoordinator für die SPD — komplettieren als „Notetaker“ die Runde. **Was Deutschlands neue Rolle im Welthandel bedeutet – verständlich, relevant, auf den Punkt.

Diese seien „keine Option für Arbeitgeber und -nehmer“, heißt es aus der Union.Von der Summe sollen zehn Milliarden Euro an die GKV und knapp sechs Milliarden an die Pflegeversicherung gehen. Den Spielraum im Haushalt muss Lars Klingbeil allerdings noch schaffen. PLENARSAALEBENECHEFSESSEL: Gestern wurden in den 24 Ausschüssen die Vorsitzenden gewählt — doch nicht alle erhielten eine Mehrheit. Die sechs Ausschüsse, die die AfD gezogen hatte, werden jetzt vorerst vom dienstältesten Mitglied im Ausschuss geleitet.Einzeltäter: Nur wenige Abgeordnete der anderen Parteien schenkten den AfD-Kandidaten ihre Stimmen — im Haushalts- und Innenausschuss gab es jeweils zwei anonyme Unterstützer für die AfD, im Finanz- und Rechtsausschuss einen.Eine Übersicht, wer in den anderen Parteien jetzt welchen Ausschuss leitet, finden Sie hier. Und wie geht’s weiter in den vorsitzlosen Ausschüssen? Dort könnten in zwei Wochen — in der nächsten Sitzungswoche — neue Kandidaten vorgeschlagen werden. Oder die alten noch einmal antreten. BYE-BYE, MODULBAU: Seit Anfang 2022 sitzen zahlreiche Abgeordnete im — bei einigen MdBs ungeliebten — Modulbau in der Adele-Schreiber-Krieger-Straße. Bis Anfang nächsten Jahres soll der bunte Übergangsbau abgeordnetenfrei werden.Der Plan: Sie sollen in den neuen Erweiterungsbau für das Marie-Elisabeth-Lüders-Haus (MELH II) ziehen, sobald dieser fertig ist. Schon im März informierte die SPD-Fraktion ihre Abgeordneten über den Umzug, wie ein Papier zeigt, das Jasper Bennink in die Hände bekommen hat. In der vergangenen Fraktionssitzung am Dienstag wurde der Umzug noch einmal bestätigt. Nach aktuellem Stand werde Anfang 2026 für den Umzug angepeilt, teilt die Bundestagsverwaltung Jasper mit.Den Übergangsbau, der sich theoretisch einfach abbauen ließe, gibt der Bundestag aber nicht auf. „Nutzer aus anderen Liegenschaften werden dort einziehen, um in den anderen Gebäuden Platz für Sanierungsarbeiten herzustellen“, heißt es. FÜNFZEHN JAHRE ZU SPÄT: 2010 haben die Arbeiten am MELH II begonnen. Und jede Menge Verzögerungen und Kostensteigerungen folgten. 430 Millionen Euro ist der Endpreis, 190 Millionen waren kalkuliert. Ein Pleiten-Pech-und-Pannen-Bau.Bekannt ist das MELH inzwischen auch durch die Bilder von den Pressekonferenzen während der schwarz-roten Koalitionsverhandlungen. 400 Büros sind es insgesamt, die Nutzfläche im Haus beläuft sich auf 16.300 Quadratmeter. „Nach erfolgten Prüfungen und Abnahmen wird der Erweiterungsbau schrittweise in diesem Jahr übergeben“, höre ich vom Bundesamt für Bauwesen und Raumordnung.LÄNDERPUNKTEDOUBLE DOWN: Nach einer Entschließung nach dem Angriff der Hamas auf Israel am 7. Oktober 2023 möchte der Bundesrat morgen zum Anlass von 60 Jahren deutsch-israelischen Beziehungen einen Beschluss zur Unterstützung Israels fassen. Darin betonen alle 16 Länder, die Verflechtungen zwischen Deutschland und Israel weiter auszubauen. Zudem fordern sie die Freilassung der israelischen Geiseln und einen sofortigen Stopp der Angriffe auf Israel.Genau lesen: Vollen Support für seine Handlungen bekommt Israel aber nicht, der Bundesrat sorgt sich um die aktuelle Situation in Gaza. Im Antrag fordert er die Bundesregierung dazu auf, auf eine „Einhaltung des Völkerrechts und insbesondere des humanitären Völkerrechts durch alle am Konflikt beteiligten Parteien im Gazastreifen zu dringen“. Ob der Entschließungsantrag — wie erwartet — mit großer Mehrheit durch den Rat geht, wird sich Israels Botschafter Ron Prosor von der Tribüne aus anschauen.EUROVISIONBESUCH AUS DEM NORDEN: Alexander Dobrindt trifft heute den dänischen Migrations- und Integrationsminister Kaare Dybvad Bek. Am Vormittag setzen sie sich im BMI zusammen; im Anschluss gibt es eine Pressekonferenz.Es ist ein angenehmer Besuch: Dänemark, das ab Juli die rotierende EU-Ratspräsidentschaft übernimmt, unterstützt den deutschen Migrationskurs und hätte auch nichts dagegen, in der EU allgemein eine härtere Linie zu fahren. Das ist ein merklicher Unterschied zu Nachbarn wie Luxemburg, Polen oder der Schweiz, die zuletzt lautstark gegen schärfere Grenzkontrollen und Dobrindts Zurückweisungspläne protestiert hatten. Auch von der deutsch-französischen Grenze gibt es Beschwerden: In einem gemeinsamen Brief an Merz warnen die Bürgermeister von Straßburg und dem benachbarten deutschen Kehl vor „ganz erhebliche Beeinträchtigungen für unseren gemeinsamen Lebensraum“.DARUM GEHT ES AUCH HEUTE UNTER DIPLOMATEN: Für zwei Tage treffen sich die in der EU stationierten deutschen Botschafter und Generalkonsuln im Auswärtigen Amt. Auf der Agenda: Deutschlands Europapolitik nach der Bundestagswahl (und da bleibt die Migrationsfrage nicht aus) sowie Handel und Wettbewerbsfähigkeit.Die Top-Diplomaten tauschen sich dabei mit Außenminister Johann Wadephul, Europastaatsminister Gunther Krichbaum, Merz’ Europa-Berater Michael Clauß, der EU-Erweiterungskommissarin Marta Kos und den Staatssekretären aus dem BMWE, Bernhard Kluttig, und dem BMF, Jeanette Schwamberger, aus.TRANSATLANTIKDIE HEIKLE FRAGE NACH DEN SANKTIONEN: Lange ist es her, dass die Europäer in Absprache mit Trump dem russischen Präsidenten Wladimir Putin mit „massiven“ Sanktionen gedroht hatten, sollte dieser nicht die Waffen ruhen lassen. Geschehen ist das nicht.Problem: Donald Trump will von dieser Drohung nichts mehr wissen. Um die eigene Glaubwürdigkeit aufrechtzuerhalten, will Europa handeln.Deshalb: Europa hofft nun ganz konkret auf einen Gesetzentwurf des Senators Lindsey Graham. Der traditionelle Russland-Falke hat ein Maßnahmenpaket ausgearbeitet, das Strafzölle in Höhe von 500 Prozent für alle Länder vorsieht, die russisches Öl und Gas kaufen.Ausgestreckte Hand: „Ich habe mit Ursula von der Leyen gesprochen. Ich will das mit ihr koordinieren“, sagte Graham zu Gregor Schwung. Die Kommissionschefin wird das gerne hören. Einerseits, weil man zusammen mit Washington einen größeren Effekt erzielen würde. Aber auch, weil es die Gefahr reduzieren würde, dass Länder wie Ungarn es wagen, neue Sanktionen zu blockieren.Graham schob aber noch eine weitreichende Forderung hinterher. Er will, dass sich Europa auch inhaltlich an seinem Katalog orientieren. „Ich habe Ursula gesagt, wir werden keine Lösung des Problems bekommen, wenn wir uns nicht China widmen“, sagte der Senator. Man müsse den Druck auf Peking erhöhen, „damit es nicht mehr Putins Kriegsmaschine füttert“, so Graham. „Ich hoffe, Europa macht mit.“Damit gerät Brüssel in eine schwierige Lage. Kann die EU es sich leisten parallel zum Handelskrieg mit Trump, es sich mit Peking zu verderben?Graham will das Paket demnächst durchbringen. Von Putin würde bald eine Ausformulierung seiner Bedingungen für eine Waffenruhe erwartet. Sollte dabei klar werden, dass Putin weiterhin an seinen Maximalforderungen festhält, wisse man, dass er es nicht ernst meine mit dem Frieden, so Graham. „Dann werden wir handeln“, sagte der Senator entschieden.Warum eine Verabschiedung des Pakets im Senat aber dennoch unwahrscheinlich ist, lesen Sie heute Morgen bei meinen Kollegen in unserem US-Newsletter DC Decoded.NEUES VON POLITICOONE MORE THING: Am 16.

ABENDBOTSCHAFTENKONTROVERS: Im ausführlichen Gespräch forderte der Ex-Innenminister Horst Seehofer seinen Nachfolger Alexander Dobrindt nach den ersten Zurückweisungen zu weiteren Schritten bei der Migrationswende auf. „Worauf’s ankommt, ist, dass die richtige Migrationspolitik ein Paket ist“, sagte Seehofer. Niedrigere Sozialleistungen seien ein Weg, aber auch die Verbesserung der Menschen in den Fluchtgebieten.MAISCHBERGER: Ob die Union an ihrem Unvereinbarkeitsbeschluss mit der Linken festhält, ließ Jens Spahn am Abend offen. „Wir haben eine Mehrheit für alles, was wir brauchen. Und wir haben nicht vor, jeden Tag das Grundgesetz zu ändern.“ Dafür nämlich — beispielsweise für eine Änderung der Schuldenbremse — bräuchte es Stimmen von Linken oder AfD. MARKUS LANZ: Am Abend stellte Matthias Miersch eine Prognose für die Lieferung von Taurus-Marschflugkörpern in den Raum — der Ukraine dürfte sie nicht gefallen. „Ich gehe davon aus, dass es dazu nicht kommt“, sagte er. JOBWECHSELTRAUM ERFÜLLT: Erstmals seit 25 Jahren stellt die Union mit Henning Otte wieder den Wehrbeauftragten.

            "description": "Budi Gunadi Sadikin has come under recent fire for contentious remarks, such as higher earners being “healthier and smarter”. But despite mixed reactions to his policies and lack of medical experience, President Prabowo Subianto could keep him on, say experts.",
            "content": "JAKARTA: From making moves that would allow general practitioners to perform risky birth surgery, to controversial statements saying men with larger jeans sizes will “meet God sooner”, Indonesia’s health minister has come under heavy public criticism lately. Some have even called for his resignation. As of Wednesday (May 21) evening, an online petition calling for Budi Gunadi Sadikin to be removed from office has been signed 8,600 times since it started on May 4. “Throughout his tenure, the health minister has issued numerous policies and statements which are not pro-people, not based on scientific data and tarnish the credibility of health professionals,” the petition wrote. The health minister’s policies and offhand remarks also led to a fierce debate over whether Indonesia’s top health post should be reserved for professionals with a medical background. Over the last few days, lecturers from three of Indonesia’s biggest public universities: Jakarta’s University of Indonesia, West Java’s Padjadjaran University and East Java’s Airlangga University wrote open letters to President Prabowo Subianto, asking him to review Budi’s performance and policies. The Alumni Association of University of Indonesia’s Faculty of Medicine joined the chorus of condemnation on Tuesday. “(The association) encourages President Prabowo to replace the top health official,” Wawan Mulyawan, a neurosurgeon and association chairman, told reporters, as quoted by local media platform Tempo, adding that some of Budi’s policies and statements “have crossed the line”. Analysts say the level of distrust shown by medical professionals and academics towards the minister is worrying as it affects how government policies are implemented on the ground. “If this distrust drags on, the quality of health services people receive will be at risk,” Dicky Budiman, a public health expert from Jakarta’s Yarsi University, told CNA. Budi was appointed health minister under the previous Joko Widodo government in 2020 and reappointed by Prabowo after he came to power in October. A former banker with a degree in nuclear physics, Budi is the only second health minister in Indonesia who is neither a doctor nor a public health expert. The first was Mananti Sitompul, a civil engineer, who held the position temporarily for a few months between December 1948 and March 1949 when the country was still at war with its former coloniser, the Netherlands. Budi’s business background was an asset during the turbulence of the pandemic, said some experts. However, they stressed the importance of sector experience in a post-COVID world. “During the (COVID-19) pandemic, (Budi) was the right man for the job because (Indonesia) needed someone who could make quick decisions and had good managerial skills,” Dicky said , adding that Budi’s experience in the corporate world gave him valuable expertise. “(But) it is time for the health minister position to return to people who know the (health) sector well.” However, some analysts feel that removing Budi from office and reserving the health minister position for doctors and public health experts is excessive. “(Budi) is not the only Cabinet member who has aired controversial statements. He is not even the first health minister in Indonesia who made controversial statements and policies,” said Windhu Purnomo, a public health expert from Airlangga University. “In many other countries, the health minister position is not only for people with medical backgrounds because what matters is their strategic thinking and managerial skills.” CONTROVERSIAL PLANS, STATEMENTS Criticism towards Budi intensified this month after the minister issued one controversial remark after another. On May 14, Budi revealed during a parliamentary hearing that his ministry was formulating a regulation which would allow general practitioners in remote regions to perform caesarean sections to combat the shortage of obstetricians and gynaecologists in rural areas. The ministry’s plan immediately drew pushback from the Indonesian Doctors Association and the Indonesian Obstetricians and Gynaecologists Association, both of which highlighted that such a procedure is \"complicated and risky\" and should not be performed by doctors without specialised training. Also on May 14, Budi remarked that men with a jeans size of 33 inches or more are “definitely obese” and “more likely to meet God sooner” while he was attending the launch of a new health initiative to help the elderly population of Jakarta. Three days later, on May 17, Budi made the news again, this time for saying at a discussion forum about the Health Vision Era of Prabowo in Jakarta that those with a salary of 15 million rupiah (US$914) per month “are definitely healthier and smarter” than those earning 5 million rupiah monthly. The health minister is no stranger to controversy. Budi began attracting negative attention in May last year when he announced plans to allow foreign doctors to practise in Indonesia to combat a shortage of physicians in the country, particularly specialists. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Indonesia has 0.72 doctors per 1,000 people , which is below the organisation’s standards of one doctor for 1,000 people. Doctors and health experts criticised the move, saying that the plan will only mean more competition for local doctors and does not address the problem of limited access to healthcare in remote areas, as foreign doctors are unlikely to be willing to be stationed in underdeveloped regions. Budi was criticised by the health community again for saying the “stethoscope is very unscientific” during a discussion organised by Google in June 2024 and in an October webinar saying: “My predecessors (are) medical doctors. So they train (for) 10 years, 20 years to cure sick people, not to keep people healthy.” Even when then-President Joko Widodo first named Budi as Indonesia’s health minister on Dec 20, 2020, reactions were mixed because of his non-medical background. Budi was replacing army physician Terawan Agus Putranto, who was lambasted by many health experts for his slow and complacent handling of the pandemic. But Budi, who prior to being Indonesia’s top health official was vice minister for state-owned enterprises, soon proved his worth: Making sure hospitals across the vast archipelago were equipped to treat the influx of COVID-19 patients and securing enough vaccines to inoculate some 200 million Indonesians. Budi’s handling of the pandemic was one of the reasons why Widodo’s successor Prabowo reinstated him as health minister. “In the beginning, (Budi) realised that he had little knowledge about the medical world, but he was willing to learn and listen to more qualified colleagues and stakeholders,” Windhu of Airlangga University said. “But after years of becoming a minister, he has since become overly confident in his knowledge of the health sector and started issuing statements and policies which drew the ire of medical professionals.” CREDIBILITY QUESTIONED After his statements on jeans sizes were widely lambasted on social media, the minister tried to defend his remarks, saying that he was simply choosing terms and analogies which were easy to grasp by ordinary people. “I’m simply interpreting a health tip in a way people can understand,” Budi said as quoted by the Jakarta Globe. But experts said Budi should not be oversimplifying things to the point that they start to defy medical and scientific conventions. “Even school students know that you cannot measure obesity based on the size of someone’s jeans or gauge a person’s health based on one’s salary. It is understandable that there are many people, not just those in the health sector, (who) are upset (by the statements),” public health expert Dicky said. “(The remarks) will greatly impact the credibility of the minister and the government in the eyes of ordinary citizens.” Politician Yahya Zaini of the parliament’s health and social affairs commission said the minister must choose his words carefully to avoid confusion and controversy. “All public statements should be supported by solid data,” the health commission’s deputy speaker said on May 18, as quoted by DetikNews. Even though calls for Budi to be ousted have been intensifying, Prabowo may keep him on, say some experts. “Before (Budi), there have been several members of Prabowo’s Cabinet who garnered widespread condemnation for what they said or did ,” political analyst Hendri Satrio of Jakarta’s Paramadina University told CNA. Among Prabowo’s ministers who once faced mounting calls to be replaced was energy and mineral resources minister Bahlil Lahadalia, who on Feb 1 decreed that subsidised cooking gas, which was originally sold at small stalls and convenience stores, should only be sold at “authorised distributors”. The move resulted in a public backlash after residents were forced to travel far and wait for hours to acquire the subsidised cooking gas. Less than one week later, Prabowo intervened and repealed the regulation. Another was Yandri Susanto, the minister of villages and development of disadvantaged regions, who was alleged to have used his position and influence to swing votes in favour of his wife Ratu Rachmatu Zakiyah, who was running in the November regional election in Serang regency, just west of Jakarta. Ratu was on May 9 declared the winner of the Serang election but not before the Constitutional Court on Feb 25 ruled that Yandri had indeed intervened in the election process and ordered a revote in some polling stations. “(These ministers) were reprimanded but still got to keep their jobs. I think the same will happen to the health minister,” Hendri said. The political analyst said despite the controversies, Budi has shown Prabowo that he can deliver some of the president’s goals and campaign promises such as the free health check initiative which was rolled out in February and the upgrading of thousands of healthcare facilities in remote areas. But even if he manages to keep his job, Budi would still need to work hard to regain the trust of medical workers and ordinary citizens, public health expert Windhu said. “Going forward, he should focus on what he does best, worry about strategic and managerial matters and leave the technical, medical matters to his vice minister (Dante Saksono) and directors who do have backgrounds in health,” he said. “(Budi) must focus on getting work done and showing results. That is the only way to regain the trust and support of the general public and health professionals because without their support, no government policy can be implemented successfully.”",

Labour went on to win and win big, but the going in government got tough and got tough quickly. Today, 12 months on, we can expect a blizzard of news. Some in government are trying to dress this up as what they are calling \"legacy Thursday\" - their latest attempt to blame the Conservatives for what they are now having to do. Take the handover of the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean - the signing ceremony for which is happening today . Labour sources say the last Conservative government held multiple rounds of negotiations on the future of the military base on Diego Garcia, because its future was threatened, but failed to agree to a deal. The Conservatives now argue this deal is a big mistake, not least because it will involve British taxpayers paying to rent back something it until now had owned. The second example the government is pointing to is the sentencing review, which the government asked the former Conservative minister David Gauke to compile. At the core of this is the bald truth that the previous government and this one have each come remarkably close to running out of prison places. Labour blame the Conservatives for failing to build enough new prison places and claim the reason Sunak called the election when he did - rather than serve another six months or so, as he could have chosen to do - was because his party wanted to \"cut and run\" from the problems that were stacking up. It is an interesting strategy, not least because I wonder at what point diminishing returns kick in when Labour is kicking out at its predecessor, when it's approaching the first anniversary of taking office itself. As part of this blizzard of news, there is an eye-catching idea from the Ministry of Justice that it wants to castrate sex offenders - using chemicals. The Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood is exploring whether the approach could be mandatory, rather than voluntary, although such a step appears a long way off. Then there are the net migration figures, the latest numbers on legal migration and new data is expected on the use of hotels to house asylum seekers. And, as if that wasn't enough, some public sector pay deals are expected too. Ministers are seeking to flex the muscles of government to try to show what it has and is trying to achieve. Little wonder: they have had a bumpy start, with a tricky economic backdrop and a wildly competitive and splintering political landscape and shrivelling opinion poll scores. Being able to demonstrate delivery is their central hope for clawing back some popularity.",

Senate President Francis Escudero has formally invited the House of Representatives panel of prosecutors to appear before them for Vice President Sara Duterte’s impeachment trial on June 2, ahead of the impeachment court’s official convening the following day. Based on a copy of a letter from Escudero’s office, the Senate president informed Speaker Martin Romualdez that the Senate “shall be ready to receive the House of Representatives’ panel of prosecutors” at 4 p.m. on the afternoon of June 2. A female vlogger in a viral road rage video was found guilty of two offenses and was ordered to pay a fines, the Land Transportation Office (LTO) said on Wednesday. Based on a seven-page decision, the LTO said that Alyana Mari Aguinaldo, or popularly known as “Yanna” was charged with Reckless Driving (Section 48 of Republic Act (RA) No. 4136 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code), operating a motor vehicle without side mirrors, and using a motorcycle without attached plate number (Section 18 of RA 4316).

            "content": "Malik Shabazz representing Black Lawyers for Justice, second from left, leads a rally May 20 in Annapolis demanding the Maryland General Assembly override a veto by Gov. Wes Moore (D) of the Reparations Commission bill. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters) Gov. Wes Moore’s veto of the Maryland Reparations Commission bill came as a shock to lawmakers here, but they are confident they can override the veto, making it little more than a temporary setback for the initiative. “We’re not done in getting this bill into a law. That is the ultimately goal, no matter what hurdles are in front of us,” said Del. Aletheia McCaskill (D-Baltimore County), who sponsored a House version of the measure and helped pass Senate Bill 587 , sponsored by Sen. C. Anthony Muse (D-Prince George’s). For advocates around the country, however, the shock is still being felt. They worry about what the bill’s troubles in Maryland — a state with a Black governor, a Black attorney general, a Black House Speaker, a Democratic super-majority and a powerful Legislative Black Caucus — portend for efforts in their own states. “Gov. Moore needs to realize that he’s not only impacting Maryland, but he’s impacting South Carolina and many other states with the veto,” said South Carolina state Rep. John King, a Democrat from the Rock Hill area of the state. The Maryland bill called for the creation of a commission that would assess specific federal, state and local policies from 1877 to 1965, the post-Reconstruction and Jim Crow eras, that “led to economic disparities based on race, including housing, segregation and discrimination, redlining, restrictive covenants, and tax policies.” The all-volunteer commission would also have examined how public and private institutions may have benefited from those policies, and would then recommend appropriate reparations, which could include statements of apology, monetary compensation, social service assistance, business incentives or child care costs. Unlike previous years, when reparations bills had price tags of $1 million or more, the bill passed this year drew heavily on volunteers and existing resources, and was expected to cost $54,500 in its first year. In his veto letter , Moore praised the work and the intentions of those behind the bill, but said “now is not the time for another study. Now is the time for continued action that delivers results for the people we serve.” He cited a number of studies over the past 25 years on the legacy of slavery, and promised that his legislative agenda next year would include a package of proposals to “address the barriers that have walled off Black families in Maryland from work, wages and wealth for generations.” SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE Those justifications appeared to be lost on many advocates, however, who called the veto everything from shocking to a betrayal. King expressed his disappointment on his Facebook page Monday, when he called on his state’s Democratic Party to rescind an invitation to Moore, who is scheduled to be the featured speaker at the party’s annual Blue Palmetto Dinner on May 30 in South Carolina. Tickets start at $150 for the dinner, which has featured potential presidential candidates in the past, like U.S. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who headlined last year’s dinner with Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.). “I will still support [the] governor, if he decided to run for president,” said King, who spent summers in Maryland where his mother grew up in the Baltimore area. But in light of the reparations veto, “I don’t think the timing is right for him to come to South Carolina,” he said in an interview Tuesday. South Carolina Democratic Party officials did not respond to requests for comment, but as recently as Wednesday the party was sending out email appeals urging people to buy tickets for the dinner and the chance to “hear from Maryland Governor Wes Moore.” King’s colleague, Rep. Annie McDaniel, a Democrat from Fairfield, said she also disagrees with Moore’s veto. “I’m not saying whether the governor’s right or wrong. I’m just saying that the way he chose to handle this is not good,” McDaniel said in an interview Tuesday. “It’s not good for the plight that African Americans are on now in this state.” But McDaniel, who chairs the state’s Legislative Black Caucus, also said Moore should attend the Blue Palmetto Dinner and explain himself. She said she would also like to see an invitation extended to Del. Jheanelle Wilkins (D-Montgomery), the chair of the Maryland Legislative Black Caucus. “I think that would be an awesome opportunity,” McDaniel said. “I don’t want the conversation to be one-sided. I believe in fairness. I just think that having her [Wilkins] in the room and having him [Moore] in the room at the same time will give us an opportunity to hear both sides.” Wilkins declined to comment Tuesday. A spokesperson for the governor’s office also declined to comment. Moore’s veto Friday was announced hours after he spoke at commencement for the University of Maryland Eastern Shore , one of the state’s four historically Black colleges and universities, and the day before an unrelated reparations rally in Washington, D.C. The governor’s decision has sparked some conversation on online broadcasts and among civil rights organizations. David Johns, CEO and executive director of the National Black Justice Collective, called the governor’s decision in a statement Tuesday “a betrayal of generational efforts to pursue truth, healing, and repair.” “As the first Black governor of Maryland, Gov. Moore had an opportunity to lead with moral clarity, political courage, and historical awareness,” Johns said in a statement Tuesday. “Instead, his decision represents a dangerous step backward in the long and necessary march toward racial justice.” Outside the State House on Tuesday, as the governor was inside for the last bill-signing of the year, a small group of protesters stood on Lawyers Mall, holding signs and chanting : “What do we want? Reparations! When do we want it? Now!” The rally was led by Malik Shabazz, an attorney representing Black Lawyers for Justice, who said the legislature should override Moore’s veto. “Clearly, the governor’s not for reparations,” Shabazz said to reporters. “And clearly, he’s looking to cut off a study and calculation of an assessment of the damages of what has been done to the people and the constituents of his own state, and that’s unacceptable.” But Linda Lee Tarver, with the Black conservative organization Project 21, said Wednesday that reparations aren’t the answer to help Black communities. Tarver, who runs a political consulting business in Lansing, Michigan, agreed with Moore’s veto message that studies have been, and continue to be, done by other organizations . She referenced her own group’s policy recommendations, which include election integrity, reducing “harmful ‘environmental justice’ agenda,” making health care more market oriented and protecting science, technology, engineering and math instruction “from the poison of ‘equity’ activists.” She said she was surprised at the apparent disconnect between Moore and the Legislative Black Caucus, which had endorsed the reparations bill. “I believe that Gov. Wes Moore got caught in pretending to care for reparations, and then his pen was required, and he punted,” Tarver said. “It’s shameful. Just say up front you don’t believe in it.” Disconnect or not, McCaskill said the debate is healthy — and the debate will continue as the commission moves forward, as she believes it will. “I am excited to hear that it’s on folks’ minds, in opposition or proponents for it,” she said. “This commission is important to hear from all Marylanders because it will eventually affect every Marylander.”",

            "content": "Dozens of people offered thoughts during a Wednesday public meeting about what the new innovation district in North Omaha should look like. (Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner) OMAHA — Could North Omaha create its own version of Kansas City’s Keystone Innovation District? Or Indianapolis’ 16 Tech, or the RICE innovation hub in Atlanta, which focuses on building Black businesses? The three campuses were spotlighted Wednesday as examples of entrepreneurial and tech-centric hubs akin to what could be built locally as the Omaha Inland Port Authority embarks on its newest mission: development of an innovation district, funded partly with $30 million in state funding. Nearly 100 people turned out for the public meeting that kicked off a six-month visioning process for the new district, which is to be developed within the boundaries of the port authority’s roughly 3,000 acres in North Omaha, near Eppley Airfield. Davielle Phillips, an Omaha architect who is vice chair of the port authority board, said the initiative got off to a good start, with more participation than anticipated at the meeting held at the Venue at Highlander Accelerator. The board is also overseeing development of an industrial-focused business park funded by a separate $90 million state grant. That initiative, in contrast, was beset early on by criticism that the development team did not seek enough public engagement and input. For the innovation district, the port authority board hired HR&A Advisors Inc. as a consultant that, along with partners Lamp Rynearson and Vireo, are to create a business plan model for the local innovation district. The consulting contract is for $546,000. During the public meeting Wednesday, the consultant team presented demographic and other data about the North Omaha area and offered examples of other innovation districts. It also highlighted the health-focused EDGE District rising on the University of Nebraska Medical Center campus. Participants split into groups to discuss what they’d like such a district to look like and achieve. Several said they’d like housing to be a component, along with job training. Many said they’d want the campus to nurture and grow tech startups; draw young talent; raise the area’s per capita income and have a multigenerational and multicultural flair. One group said music should play a role, along with cultural events and block parties to build community. Phillips said his goals for the meeting were met, including good attendance and engagement. He said he also wanted to clarify that the innovation district is separate from the long-discussed industrial business park, which was met with resistance from many area residents who worried the city might use the power of eminent domain to force acquisition. That option has been ruled out. “I want to let people know we heard them; we listened,” Phillips said of the gathering. Other port authority board members attended, including mayoral chief of staff Tom Warren, as did North Omaha City Councilwoman-elect LaVonya Goodwin. Tuesday, focus groups were invited to offer input. Next steps, Phillips and the consultant said, include a public meeting this summer to continue to build upon the ideas. Still to be determined is the exact location of the innovation district within the port authority boundaries, along with its size, shape and character, Phillips said. He said the port authority board likely would seek bids for a developer to build out the district campus. Both the innovation district and the industrial business park are to be anchors of the port authority and are seen as key to helping more private businesses produce jobs and economic development that benefits North Omaha area residents. Funds for both projects originally were approved by the Nebraska Legislature as part of the Nebraska Economic Recovery Act of 2022, seeded with federal pandemic-related dollars, though the legislation and funding sources have since been updated.

INQUIRER FILES LUCENA CITY, Philippines — Police in Cavite, Laguna and Quezon provinces arrested five suspected drug pushers on Wednesday, May 21, and seized more than P552,000 worth of “shabu” (crystal meth) along with three unlicensed firearms, authorities said. The Police Regional Office 4A reported Thursday that anti-narcotics operatives in Dasmariñas City, Cavite, arrested three suspects identified only as “Shinedel,” “Floyd,” and “Julius” after selling P500 worth of shabu to a poseur buyer in Barangay Datu Esmael around 8 p.m. Authorities recovered four plastic sachets containing suspected shabu weighing 70 grams with an estimated value of P476,000, based on the Dangerous Drugs Board valuation. Also seized were an undocumented .22-caliber pistol with two bullets and a mobile phone, which will be examined for potential drug-related information. Police classified Shinedel and Floyd as high-value individuals (HVIs), typically identified as traffickers, financiers, or members of drug groups. Julius was tagged as a street-level pusher. In Santa Cruz, Laguna, police arrested “Sergio,” a known street-level pusher, during a buy-bust operation in Barangay Bagumbayan around 11 p.m. Recovered from Sergio were three sachets of suspected shabu worth P66,600 and an unlicensed .45-caliber pistol loaded with six bullets. Police also impounded a motorcycle allegedly used in his drug transactions. In Pagbilao town, Quezon province, local police apprehended a street-level pusher identified as “Joshua” in a sting operation at 11:55 p.m. in Barangay Pinagbayan. Joshua was allegedly found in possession of a .38-caliber revolver with three bullets and sachets of suspected shabu valued at P10,268.

            "content": "Prime Minister Mark Carney said he he's had talks with US President Donald Trump about it. The defense system designed to detect, track and potentially intercept incoming missiles. Canada is conducting \"high level\" talks with the United States over joining President Donald Trump's proposed \"Golden Dome\" missile defense program , Prime Minister Mark Carney said on Wednesday. Trump announced his plans the previous day to develop the multilayered, $175 billion (€155 billion) system with ground- and space-based capabilities that can defend against a wide range of enemy weapons, like drones, hypersonic and cruise missiles, and intercontinental ballistic missiles. The US President said he expected the missile shield to be ready by the end of his second term in 2029. 'Good to have protections,' says Canada Speaking at a news conference in Ottawa on Wednesday, Carney confirmed he's had discussions with Trump about the program, adding that talks are underway between senior officials. Carney cautioned about new and growing missile threats, warning that \"in the not too distant future could come from space,\" adding that his government takes those threats \"seriously\". \"Is it a good idea for Canada? Yes, it is good to have protections in place for Canadians,\" the newly elected Prime Minister said. \"We are conscious that we have an ability, if we so choose, to complete the Golden Dome with investments in partnership (with the US). And it's something that we are looking at and something that has been discussed at a high level,\" he told reporters. He did not provide further details on how much Canada might contribute to the program. Troubled US-Canada ties Washington and Ottawa are partners in the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), that is responsible for the defense of the airspace over both countries. Simultaneously, Canada is also seeking to diversify its trade and security alliances amid fraying ties with the US . It recently announced a review of a major purchase of US-made F-35 fighter jets and etched an agreement with Australia to develop Arctic radar systems. Trump has irked Canada by saying that it should be the 51st US state. Carney has said that Canada's old relationship with the US, which was based on steadily increasing integration, is over.

            "content": "For years, the cries of grieving families have echoed in the halls of power — dismissed, deflected and ignored. Now, with the Department of Justice finally opening a criminal investigation into former Gov. Andrew Cuomo for allegedly lying to Congress about his administration’s role in New York’s nursing home COVID deaths, we have our first real glimmer of hope. This is a moment of reckoning. And it’s long, long overdue. More than 15,000 seniors perished in New York’s nursing homes after Cuomo’s infamous March 25, 2020, directive forced facilities to accept COVID-positive patients. The result was as deadly as it was predictable. But what followed was arguably even worse: a calculated coverup. Cuomo and his inner circle allegedly doctored a state Health Department report in July 2020 to conceal the true death toll. While families buried loved ones, Cuomo polished his image, published a book and collected accolades — including an Emmy — built on fiction. This wasn’t just a policy failure. It was a betrayal. And for over five years, grieving families like ours were gaslit and told to move on. That’s why Voices for Seniors was formed — not just by us after the tragic deaths of our loved ones but by a collective of heartbroken, determined citizens who came together to speak for the voiceless. We represent over 15,000 families demanding what we were never given: answers, transparency and justice. We’ve spent years fighting for the truth while Cuomo played politics with our pain. And now, some are acting shocked that the DOJ is investigating him? Please. Of course Cuomo lied. The criminal investigation is not only justified — it’s necessary. He knowingly misled Congress by downplaying his administration’s role in obscuring the true number of nursing home deaths, all to protect his political ambitions. This isn’t speculation; it’s the reason federal prosecutors are now involved. The investigation exists because the facts — not political vendettas — demand accountability. Not partisan warfare Let’s be clear: This is not about partisan warfare. The virus didn’t discriminate along party lines — and neither should justice. This is about human dignity. About whether public officials can knowingly mislead the nation during a public health crisis and walk away unscathed. The fact that it took this long for a DOJ investigation to be launched speaks volumes about the political insulation that has protected Cuomo. But no one — no matter how powerful — is above the law. And no family should be forced to spend years screaming into the void for the truth. This investigation is not “election interference.” It is not a “witch hunt.” It is the bare minimum accountability for a man who has done everything in his power to escape it. And let’s not ignore the timing: Cuomo is floating a political comeback — a run for New York City mayor — counting on voters to forget the trauma he inflicted on thousands of families. But we haven’t forgotten. And we won’t let others forget, either. Voices for Seniors will continue to fight on behalf of those who no longer can. We are committed to full cooperation with the DOJ and will not rest until the truth is fully revealed and accountability is served. The era of impunity must end. The coverup must end. And the silence? That ended the moment we stood up and said: Enough. Vivian Zayas is founder of the advocacy group Voices for Seniors, where Tracey Alvino is a board member.",

            "content": "Montgomery County Councilmember Will Jawando, right, gives remarks after County Executive Marc Elrich endorsed Jawando to succeed him in the position next year. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters) At-Large Montgomery County Councilmember Will Jawando (D) said Wednesday he will run to replace current County Executive Marc Elrich (D), who is term-limited and cannot run for a third term next year. Elrich was on hand Wednesday night with at least 200 others for Jawando’s announcement at Citizens and Culture in Silver Spring. “People need to know you’re going to fight. If they know you’re going to fight, they respect you. They deal with you,” Elrich said. “That’s one of the things that I like about Will, and what I think he brings to this race is that kind of leadership. “The other thing is independence. You cannot elect the county executive who already has millions of dollars from developers,” he said. Other speakers included fellow Democratic County Councilmembers Laurie-Anne Sayles and Kristin Mink, and former “The Real Housewives of Potomac” cast member Candiace Dillard Bassett . Support also came from Prince George’s County State’s Attorney Aisha Braveboy (D), who is heavily favored in a June 3 special election for county executive there to fill out the term of former Executive Angela Alsobrooks (D), who was elected to the U.S. Senate last fall. “It matters who you elect as executives in this capital region,” said Braveboy, pointing to the challenges from the Trump administration for local governments. “I can’t think of a brighter, smarter, tougher person for Montgomery County than you. We’re all about diversity, equity and inclusion. We’re going to keep talking about it.” Jawando, 42, was elected in 2018 to an at-large council seat from the county of 1 million people, the state’s largest. He’s an attorney who’s worked in the U.S. Senate for then-Sen. Barack Obama and for former Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown. He was the first to announce a bid for the Democratic nomination to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Ben Cardin, but he withdrew in October 2023 . SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX On Wednesday, Jawando highlighted some of his priorities as county executive, such as supporting rent stabilization and affordable housing, continuing to invest in the public schools and supporting small businesses, which he said represent about 80% of county businesses. He touched on the importance of diversity and the “beautiful tapestry” at the restaurant and throughout the county. He talked about his family, including his parents, a Nigerian father and white mother who moved to Montgomery from his mother’s home state of Kansas in 1980. Besides Jawando walking on stage and his wife, Michele, giving rousing remarks, some of the biggest applause came when he mentioned potholes. “I promise to fix your potholes in your neighborhood. I know that’s a problem,” he said. “When you have good streets, you have good commerce, and you have good safety. It’s a good thing.” At least two other candidates have announced bids for county executive. Celeste Iroha, a registered medical assistant, was the first person to announce in March, according to Bethesda Today, whike At-Large County Councilmember Evan Glass (D) said Wednesday he qualified to use the county’s public financing option. Glass, who was the first openly LGBTQ+ member of the council when elected in 2018, would become the first as county executive, if elected. County Councilmember Andrew Friedson (D) is expected to also enter the county executive race. Montgomery and Prince George’s aren’t the only counties getting new leaders. Howard County Executive Calvin Ball (D) and Anne Arundel County Executive Steuart Pittman (D) are both term limited and cannot seek a third term next year. In Baltimore County, former state Sen. Kathy Klausmeier (D) was appointed replace County Executive Johnny Olszewski Jr. when he was elected to Congress last fall, but she is not expected to seek reelection next year. Baltimore County Councilman Pat Young (D), one of four Democrats eyeing the executive’s seat, announced Wednesday he will be the first candidate in the race to fund his campaign through public financing . The council approved the law in 2021 and funds will be available for disbursements next month for the 2026 election cycle. Frederick County Executive Jessica Fitzwater (D) and Harford County Executive Robert Cassilly (R) are both able to run for reelection next year.",

            "content": "It’s the new Hunger Games of world politics — the televised Oval Office take-down by President Donald Trump. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa was the latest leader to become a MAGA prop Wednesday, as Trump lectured him on false claims that White South African farmers are the victims of a genocide . Foreign leaders now enter the hallowed lair of the US president — who runs press conferences like they’re WWE cage matches — at their peril. Trump’s dressings-down are a metaphor for a US foreign policy that is erratic, politicized and awash in conspiracy theories. As Ukraine and Jordan also found out, the more vulnerable a country, the more hostile a reception they tend to get. Giving the growing political risks of appearing in the Oval Office, it would not be surprising if some leaders reconsider what was once a coveted invitation but is now a political trap. This could have diplomatic consequences, with Global South nations like South Africa now looking more to China than the US. Ramaphosa knew what was coming. He was joined by his White agriculture minister in the new multiracial coalition government. Trump’s friends the South African major champion golfers Ernie Els and Retief Goosen were also drafted in. But that didn’t stop Trump dimming the lights and rolling out a multimedia show of right-wing propaganda about South Africa . “Death, death, death,” he said, as he displayed articles about the killings of White Afrikaners. The question of more equitable land ownership is one of the most complex legacies of South Africa’s years of minority rule. But as Ramaphosa explained, there’s no systematic attempt to wipe out a community based on race or ethnicity — the definition of genocide. And most victims of violent crime are Black. Zelensky overshadows every meeting Every Oval Office meeting now takes place in the haunting shadow of the brutal inquisition of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky by Trump and Vice President JD Vance in February. Ramaphosa seemed to have learned from that shocker. While rattled, he reacted with bemusement rather than outright anger to the president’s ambush. He patiently tried to explain the facts to Trump — not that it made any difference. “They’re being executed, and they happen to be White, and most of them happen to be farmers,” Trump said. “I don’t know how you explain that.” With most presidents, Oval Office photo-ops are dull affairs. Press poolers are rushed in to hear each leader mouth platitudes about the strong relationship between the two countries. Sometimes reporters get to throw in a few questions before they are herded out to await a formal press conference later in the day. This has changed in Trump’s second term, which has shattered even those barriers of decorum that the president left in place in his first go around. The Oval Office is now more crowded and rowdier. Vance often sits on the White House sofa alongside Cabinet members waiting to pounce. This is an unusual role for the veep. During the Obama administration, then-Vice President Joe Biden often shunned the spotlight at the back of the room. Trump’s visitors must run the gauntlet of the MAGA media pack looking, like the president, for viral moments. During Zelensky’s visit, one such reporter asked the president, who wears a military-style field jacket to honor frontline troops, why he wasn’t wearing a suit to show respect. Many deep problems remain in South Africa since the end of apartheid and years of corrupt and chaotic leadership by the African National Congress after President Nelson Mandela stepped down. It’s safe to say none of those issues were helped at all by Trump’s antics. But that was clearly not the point. The president’s Oval Office shows are about signaling to the MAGA base — apparently, in this case, its White nationalist elements. Trump’s brand is based on being an outsider and a disrupter. He returned to office determined to tear down global political and trading systems that boosted US power but that he says are ripping Americans off. What better way can there be to demonstrate “America first” strongman credentials than berating foreigners on TV? Sometimes, the spectacle seems to be for the benefit of one man — Elon Musk. The South African-born mogul was in the room with Ramaphosa on Wednesday after complaining on X about discrimination against Whites in South Africa. Musk’s views also got an airing during a visit to the Oval Office by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, when Vance complained about what he said were free speech crackdowns in the UK on American-owned tech firms. Starmer, schooled by his weekly appearances at Prime Minister’s Questions in the House of Commons, made short work of the complaint. “We’ve had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom and it will last for a very, very long time.” Which leader best handled Trump in the Oval Office? Trump’s ritual humiliation of his visitors means world leaders now have a complex new dimension to their prep work. They must consider how they will come across to their electorates back home. If they fail to stand up to Trump, they will look weak. If they push back hard, they might get a domestic boost — like Zelensky — but could damage their national interests if they leave Trump nursing a grudge. And leaders must try to avoid being trapped on camera while Trump says or does something that underscores their relative weakness compared to the United States. In February, for example, King Abdullah of Jordan looked deeply uncomfortable as Trump pressed him to accept refugees from Gaza. Such an influx could topple Jordan’s fragile political balance and the monarchy itself. Yet Abdullah also knew his country depends on US aid for security, so he couldn’t rebut his host. Zelensky was another supplicant. After he was kicked out of the White House for reacting angrily to Vance’s demands for gratitude, he spent weeks making amends. The most successful Oval Office visitors are those who dole out praise for Trump without debasing themselves too much. With a theatrical flourish, Starmer pulled out a letter from King Charles III inviting Trump for a state visit, and waxed on about how this was a great honor since Trump had already had a similar invite from the late Queen Elizabeth II. Starmer is not known as a natural politician, and he got top marks at home for his unusually deft performance. French President Emmanuel Macron created the second-term playbook for correcting Trump’s wild falsehoods when he laid his hand on the US president’s wrist when he falsely claimed Europe would get back aid it has poured into Ukraine. “No, to be frank, we paid. We paid 60% of the total effort,” Macron said. Macron seemed to be relishing the high-wire political act of the Oval Office showdown. But he was careful to leaven his own statements with a large helping of “Dear Donalds.” Another leader vying to be the bridge between Europe and Trump is Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni . As a right-wing populist who often visits Mar-a-Lago, Meloni had the advantage of being among friends. But as a strong supporter of Ukraine, she was on sensitive ground that she smoothed with slick political skills. At one point, Meloni interrupted her own interpreter and assumed translation duties herself to make sure Trump fully understood a point about Italy increasing defense spending. And she curried favor by adopting the Trumpian vernacular, telling the president that they could “make the West great again.” No foreign leader faced as much domestic pressure in the Oval Office as Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney . After all, he had just won an election that was dominated by hostility over Trump’s demands to annex Canada by wrapping himself in the maple leaf flag. Carney tried talking to Trump in terms the real estate-magnate-turned-president would understand. “There are some places that are never for sale,” he said. “Having met with the owners of Canada over the course of the campaign ... it’s not for sale, won’t be for sale ever.” When Trump said, “Never say never.” Carney turned to the cameras and the True North and mouthed, “Never, never.” Trump, however, had the host’s prerogative of the last word — another hazard for world leaders visiting the Oval Office. He went on a tirade about how unfair it was that the US bears much of the cost for defending Canada militarily, then told the press to leave. Carney couldn’t get a word in edgewise. The visit everyone wants to see Leaders never know quite what might happen with Trump. Which brings us to Pope Leo XIV. Vance was at the Vatican last weekend for the pontiff’s inaugural mass and handed over an impressive white envelope bearing the presidential seal that contained an invitation for a visit to the White House. Leo was heard to say “at some point” — perhaps referring to his intention to take up the offer. But the former Robert Prevost of Chicago didn’t seem to be in a rush. Maybe that’s because it’s almost inconceivable to envision the man viewed by Roman Catholics as God’s representative on Earth willingly submitting to the Oval Office bear pit and Trump’s somewhat secular rhetoric. Any visit is likely to follow intense negotiations with the Vatican about protocol. But the spectacle of the two most famous Americans on the planet in the storied office would be something to behold.",

            "content": "US President Donald Trump hands papers to South African President Cyril Ramaphosa during a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on May 21, 2025. Agence France-Presse WASHINGTON — US President Donald Trump surprised his South African counterpart Cyril Ramaphosa during a White House meeting Wednesday by playing him a video designed to back baseless claims of a white “genocide.” Trump asked staff members to play a video on a screen set up in the Oval Office showing Ramaphosa — and the gathered global media — what he said were clips of Black South Africans talking about the issue, including images of what the US president called “burial sites.” In the video, firebrand far-left opposition lawmaker Julius Malema was shown singing “Kill the Boer, kill the farmer” — an infamous chant dating back to the apartheid-era fight against white-minority rule. READ: S. Africa leader visits Trump in White House to mend strained relations The chant is highly controversial in South Africa and was banned by a court in 2010. However a court in 2022 said that it did not constitute hate speech and should be considered in its historical context. In 2024 the Supreme Court of Appeal, seized by a right-wing Afrikaner lobby group, ruled that Malema should be allowed to continue to use the song. “Mr Malema was not actually calling for farmers, or white South Africans of Afrikaans descent, to be shot,” it said. He “was using an historic struggle song as provocative means of advancing his party’s political agenda,” the ruling said. Malema has been a loud and radical voice in South African politics for several years, but his Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party came only fourth in last year’s elections with less than 10 percent of the vote. READ: Deference and disputes: how leaders get on with Trump The 4:30-minute video aired in the White House showed clips of Malema telling dancing supporters that “we are cutting the throat of whiteness,” and “to shoot to kill.” “We have not called for the killing of white people, at least for now,” Malema said in one archival clip. Another clip showed former South African president Jacob Zuma singing an anti-apartheid song that threatens white people with being shot by a machine gun. The video finished with images of a 2020 protest in South Africa where white crosses were placed along a rural roadside to honor a couple who were murdered on their farm in the east of the country. Viral social media posts, some included in the video, have falsely claimed that dozens of white farmers are killed every day. But figures from groups representing farmers and Afrikaner interests show that around 50 people of all races are killed on farms every year.

            "content": "Canada has entered talks with the Trump administration over its inclusion in the newly announced “Golden Dome” missile defense system , according to reports. Prime Minister Mark Carney 's office said there are \"active discussions\" between the two nations on security systems – both existing and future – according to the BBC . Talks are ongoing despite tensions between the nations, stemming from Trump’s exorbitant tariffs on America’s neighbor to the north and his repeated belittling suggestion that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state. The latter has prompted a wave of patriotism from Canadians which may have contributed to the election win for Carney and the Liberal party. \"Canadians gave the prime minister a strong mandate to negotiate a comprehensive new security and economic relationship with the United States,\" Audrey Champoux, a spokeswoman for Carney, told the BBC. \"To that end, the prime minister and his ministers are having wide-ranging and constructive discussions with their American counterparts. These discussions naturally include strengthening Norad and related initiatives such as the Golden Dome.\" Champoux did not specify how Canada would participate in the Golden Dome project, including whether it would help pay to build it. Canada and the U.S. already partner on Norad – the North American Aerospace Defense Command – which operates aerospace and maritime surveillance and contributes to the defense of the region. The system has been in place since 1958, and Canada and the U.S. have both voiced intentions of modernizing it. Announcing the Golden Dome project on Tuesday, Trump acknowledged that Canada had expressed interest. “Canada has called us, and they want to be a part of it. So we’ll be talking to them; they want to have protection also,” Trump said, while taking questions at the White House. The president’s plan aims to spend $25 billion to begin work on the Dome, which he has insisted would take only three years to complete. This is in contrast to estimates by the independent Congressional Budget Office , which has estimated the project could take 20 years and cost $524 billion. “This design for the Golden Dome will integrate with our existing defense capabilities and should be fully operational before the end of my term,” Trump said. “Once fully constructed, Golden Dome will be capable of intercepting missiles even if they are launched from other sides of the world, and even if they are launched from space, and we will have the best system ever built.”",

            "content": "Canada has entered talks with the Trump administration over its inclusion in the newly announced “Golden Dome” missile defense system , according to reports. Prime Minister Mark Carney 's office said there are \"active discussions\" between the two nations on security systems – both existing and future – according to the BBC . Talks are ongoing despite tensions between the nations, stemming from Trump’s exorbitant tariffs on America’s neighbor to the north and his repeated belittling suggestion that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state. The latter has prompted a wave of patriotism from Canadians which may have contributed to the election win for Carney and the Liberal party. \"Canadians gave the prime minister a strong mandate to negotiate a comprehensive new security and economic relationship with the United States,\" Audrey Champoux, a spokeswoman for Carney, told the BBC. \"To that end, the prime minister and his ministers are having wide-ranging and constructive discussions with their American counterparts. These discussions naturally include strengthening Norad and related initiatives such as the Golden Dome.\" Champoux did not specify how Canada would participate in the Golden Dome project, including whether it would help pay to build it. Canada and the U.S. already partner on Norad – the North American Aerospace Defense Command – which operates aerospace and maritime surveillance and contributes to the defense of the region. The system has been in place since 1958, and Canada and the U.S. have both voiced intentions of modernizing it. Announcing the Golden Dome project on Tuesday, Trump acknowledged that Canada had expressed interest. “Canada has called us, and they want to be a part of it. So we’ll be talking to them; they want to have protection also,” Trump said, while taking questions at the White House.

            "description": "Trump prioritises expanding IVF access after fertility clinic bombing",
            "content": "Listen to Story A bomb blast took place at a fertility clinic in California, US, that has now drawn national attention to women's reproductive health. Days after a bombing, a White House official confirmed that the Trump administration is reviewing a series of recommendations to expand access to in vitro fertilisation (IVF), a common and costly fertility treatment. The recommendations, prepared over the past 90 days by the White House Domestic Policy Council, were submitted to President Donald Trump this week. While details of the report have not yet been made public, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement that IVF access is a \"key priority\" for the administration. \"This is a key priority for President Trump, and the Domestic Policy Council has completed its recommendations,\" Desai told Associated Press. The timing of the announcement has added weight to an already growing conversation about reproductive technology, especially in the wake of the explosion at the fertility centre in California's Palm Springs. While law enforcement officers have labeled the attack an \"act of terrorism,\" allegedly motivated by the suspect’s anti-natalist beliefs, a philosophical view that procreation is morally wrong. While this incident has worried doctors who help people have babies through IVF, it has also made more people in the US pay attention to the rules around IVF. This is especially important now because some US states have strict new laws that treat embryos (fertilised eggs) like living people . These laws could make it harder for IVF clinics to freeze or dispose of unused embryos, which is a normal part of the IVF process. Dr. Brian Levine, a New York-based reproductive endocrinologist, said the White House’s attention is unprecedented. \"For the first time in my career, IVF is a priority at the highest levels of the government. It signals to patients that finally our advocacy is being heard. Both sides of the aisle are recognizing the problem we have in this country with access to IVF care,\" he said. According to the US health agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), over 300,000 assisted reproductive technology cycles were performed in the US in 2021 alone. Yet IVF remains financially inaccessible for many. Each cycle can cost between $12,000 and $25,000, and multiple cycles are often necessary. Insurance coverage varies widely by state and plan, leaving many families to bear the burden. A PUSH FOR IVF ACCESS In February 2025, President Trump signed an executive order titled \"Expanding Access to In Vitro Fertilization,\" directing government agencies to identify strategies to \"protect and expand access to fertility treatment,\" with an emphasis on lowering out-of-pocket and insurance costs for patients . The order also calls for agencies to assess how IVF access can be improved for active-duty military members, veterans, and federal employees, a move supported by fertility specialists and advocacy groups. Trump said during his election campaign that he wants IVF treatment to be available to everyone, maybe even for free. This comes after a major court decision in 2022, during Trump's presidency, that removed the national right to abortion in the US. After that, many states led by his party, the Republicans, made strict laws that could also affect IVF. Some of these laws say life begins as soon as an egg is fertilised , which makes it harder for fertility clinics to safely store or handle embryos. Even though Trump is trying to sound supportive of IVF, many Republican-led states are still pushing for laws that could make IVF more difficult, according to a report by the Associated Press. In some places, new rules give embryos the same legal rights as people, which means destroying unused embryos could be seen as a crime. This puts both doctors and patients in a difficult position. Reproductive rights groups are not convinced by Trump’s recent statements. As everyone waits to hear the government's official plan for IVF, both doctors and patients are hoping the promises will lead to real help that’s easy to access.",

            "content": "Under new looser rules, the demand for New Zealand’s “golden visas” has risen significantly in the past six weeks, with majority of the applications coming from the US, Financial Times reported. In a bid to strengthen the country's flagging economy, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon's government relaxed the rules of its golden visa programme in February, which could lure foreign investment. 55 out of 65 applications from the US Since the revamped program was launched, it has received 65 new applications within six weeks, along with 39 carried-over applications, of which 42 have been approved, according to data from New Zealand’s immigration department. This amounts to a minimum investment of NZ$620 million. The majority of the new applications, 55 in total, originated from the United States, making it the top source country. Hong Kong and China followed with 15 and 12 applications respectively, according to the department. The new scheme, implemented in April, eliminated English-language requirements and reduced the investment threshold for \"growth\" visas to NZ$5 million (US$3 million). Applicants now need to spend only 21 days in the country to qualify for residency, a significant reduction from the previous three-year requirement. According to the immigration department, the average processing time has also been shortened to just 11 days. A higher-tier “balanced” visa requires an investment of NZ$10 million but permits investments in bonds, equities, and property development, and also includes residency benefits for family members. Former Immigration minister Stuart Nash speaks out Stuart Nash, a former immigration minister and co-founder of the relocation consultancy Nash Kelly Global, said that the re-election of US President Donald Trump has been a key factor motivating many affluent Americans to pursue residency overseas. “It’s the main driver. Many of the people applying are of a different political persuasion to President Trump,\" he said. Nash highlighted the “level of uncertainty\", adding that the uncertainty introduced into global affairs by Trump’s administration had played a role, noting that New Zealand has benefited as countries like Portugal and Ireland have tightened restrictions on their golden visa programmes. “Putin is on the doorstep and no one is 100 per cent sure what Trump will do on Nato. That kind of uncertainty means people are looking to New Zealand,\" he mentioned. Nash noted that lifestyle factors such as New Zealand having the highest number of golf courses per capita outside of Scotland have enhanced its appeal to golden visa applicants, but emphasized that political stability remains the key attraction. He said, “In the past, the vast majority of applicants were looking for tax havens. Now they’re looking for safe havens.” Additionally, the European Court of Justice ruled last month that Malta’s visa scheme was in violation of EU law. The 104 new visa applications stand in contrast to the 115 submitted between 2022 and 2025, of which only 46 were approved. In 2018, former Labour Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern implemented stricter rules on investment visas following revelations that billionaire tech entrepreneur and Trump ally Peter Thiel had been discreetly granted citizenship despite not meeting standard eligibility criteria. The incident sparked a national debate over the sale of farmland and housing to wealthy foreigners looking to secure a remote “bolt-hole” in New Zealand.",

The Hate & Extremism Report will identify the number of active hate groups in 2024 and how that compares to previous years. It will also look at anti-government group trends. The law center based in Montgomery, Alabama, tracks racism, xenophobia and far-right militias. Last year’s report found “record numbers” of white nationalist and anti-LGBTQ groups in 2023. The analysis highlighted how far-right groups tried to waylay democracy through disinformation, false conspiracy theories and threats to election workers. It also examined how supporters of Christian supremacy used similar topics to organize a movement toward authoritarianism. The SPLC is a liberal advocacy organization that, besides monitoring hate groups, files lawsuits over justice issues and offers educational programs to counter prejudice. Frequently criticized by conservatives as biased, the nonprofit has faced lawsuits for its designation of some organizations as hate groups. freestar.queue.push(function () { window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0; let customChannel = '_dynamic_' + fsAdCount; let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\") let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount]; let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2); thisAd.id = randId; let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\"; freestar.newAdSlots({ placementName: thisPlacement, slotId: randId }, customChannel); }); The report’s release comes as a Los Angeles college professor makes his first public appearance since he was severely injured in a hit and run that he reported as a hate crime.
